## Star Wars CCG Information Pool (sw-ip)

This repo exposes the card data in a way that more people are able to contribute.

The card data is now JSON, which makes it trivial for people to submit corrections and additions.

This repo also provides tools for converting the JSON into SQL compatible with the SQLite 2 format.
