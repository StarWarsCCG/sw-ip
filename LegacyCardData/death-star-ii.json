    "Information": "Article on DeckTech, August 19th, 2007 '2nd Annual SWCCG Encyclopedia of Decks' by Brandon \"Jabba_the_Ruck\" Ruck\\par http://www.decktech.net/starwarsccg/articles/articles.php?id=6526&view=2\\par \\par Popular Cards to Look For: 2 to 6 Emperor Palpatine / The Emperor (V6), multiple versions of Vader (usually Lord), any number of ways to cause you to win a battle, docking bays, Conduct Your Search, Establish Control (V11), You Are Beaten\\par \\par Idea Behind Objective: Much like There is Good in Him for LS, this objective has the ability to simply end the game by dueling. Unlike TIGIH, you have to lose the duel first, shuffle your Reserve, and then draw a random destiny in order to win. This can be set up late game by putting cards in your used pile with Drop (non-V), Reactor Terminal (non-V), or Janus. If you activate all but 3 of your Force, once you lose the first duel, you only have one card left in the Reserve to shuffle and draw. BHBM has been a strong objective for DS because the zero side allows you to continually deploy the Emperor from Reserve all game for -2 force. Common versions of this deck play with IAO Combo to pull the Death Star II: Docking Bay, the Endor: Docking bay, and maybe another random choice. If you don't want to go with the docking bays, some newer versions start Conduct Your Search to pull the Endor: Back Door for your DS drain site. This version will also play a way to pull docking bays or rely on Rise My Friend to get Vader with Luke to the DSII: Throne Room once Vader captures him. Over the years, the versions of this deck have changed only slightly to include the more powerful cards that can be used to win a battle. Cards like Maul With Stick, Blizzard 4, and Boba Fett, BH provide that extra power this deck was lacking during the early years. A very popular trick with this deck involves setting up Emperor Palpatine with Janus at the Throne Room, then every turn you use the Force Lightning the Emperor pulls as the card you put back with Janus. This allows you to get only new cards into your hand while never having to put back anything else. The Force Lightning can be grabbed if you play it for anything other than this recycling mechanism.\\par \\par How It Can Win: Just like TIGIH, this deck can win very easily if you can just figure out how to win enough battles so you can cross Luke to the DS. Most of the time, players who play this deck win the game playing the classic DS strategy of battling over and over and getting large amounts of overflow. The majority of the time, this deck will win without crossing Luke because of how quickly it can setup. Much like Huntdown, the constant battling and overflow takes it toll on the LS. BHBM is always built for battling, so it always attempts to disrupt the LS strategy. Because battling and winning the battle is your number one priority, every version plays with cards that either help you or hurt the LS. One way to do this is a version with many high-destiny characters like multiple Emperor Palpatines or if you don't own them you can sub them out for Tech Nor from A New Hope. Combined with creatures and Tauntaun Skull from Special Edition, you have the ability to place one of the 6 destiny characters out of play to add that destiny number to your total power. If you set up Emperor's Power (non-V), you can add a destiny by losing the top card of your Reserve. Adding 6 to power with at least 2 destinies can almost guarantee you to win a battle. If you play with Womp Rats/Bubo and Krayt Dragon Bones (V3) to clear away a few characters before you battle, you will have a better chance of having a higher total power as well. Other cards like You Are Beaten to exclude characters and Set for Stun to just bounce characters back to the opponent's hand are also good choices. Dr. E is very popular in these decks since he makes any 'hit' character Lost. Either version of Dr. E is good while the Combo version of him gives you higher power while the non-combo version lets you 'operate' with Disarmed. Capturing can also be a good way to win battles. Boba Fett SE (V8) can be a good option for removing someone through capturing. You can also use IG-88 With Gun or Hidden Weapons. Many versions start Crush the Rebellion to pull I Have You Now for an additional destiny in battles verse Rebels of ability >2. Most of the time, Luke will not be in a battle since Vader can just come down and capture him, so you will rarely get more than one destiny from IHYN. Crush is also good for canceling Clash of Sabers since you never want to have your big character excluding from battle. If you play enough SAC though, you don't usually have to worry about it. Human Shield can be a great card in this deck for turning a weapon from the LS against Luke or you can forfeit Luke in battle.\\par \\par What Changed Since 1st Edition: The biggest help to BHBM came from Establish Control (V11). The original BHBM used IAO and Mob Points to set up huge early activation. Since the Don't Do that Again Shield suspends Mob Points, using the docking bays fell out of use. EC (V11) brings back the +2 activation for controlling docking bays and you get to pull a battleground system (Corulag or Fondor). Many versions of BHBM already used Fonder in the deck to play the Executor, so it's nice getting to pull it first turn. Most of the updates for this deck are the same for Huntdown since both decks battle with the same characters. EPP Mara (V12) is a great addition to BHBM freeing up the card slot for her stick. Besides those cards, the main idea of BHBM is the same. All the current versions set up the same way and wait for the LS to deploy something to battle. The deck is always a solid choice getting to capture Luke and being able to end the game all at once. The problem still exists with the start. Since it only gives you one location, any LS deck that goes first and do fast damage can hurt. TRMs did take a hit with Wipe Them Out, All of Them (V9), so BHBM has a better chance in the current environment.\\par \\par Why I SHOULD Play It: BHBM can be a very powerful deck for DS. Many LS strategies rely on Luke in some form to set up or hold their strategy. Speeders have Commander Luke (V4), MWYHL sometimes uses Son of Skywalker (V5), Hidden Base uses Luke Skywalker (V1), Combat uses Jedi Luke, Profit uses Master Luke, and then you might see new decks with Luke (V10) + Begger's Canyon. BHBM is the reason that every LS deck, no matter what, should have at least one copy of Luke. Your Destiny causing 3 Force loss can hurt over the course of a game. Even Agents will play a Jedi Luke just in case. The other thing about BHBM that makes it worth looking at is being able to pull the Emperor from Reserve. The Emperor (V6) going down first turn can really disrupt the LS strategy. Profit allows you to start Dr E and EPP Mara, then you download the Emperor (V6) to auto shock anyone who comes down. This also works with Agents that sets up in the AC. You have the ability to set him up before they have BoShuda, so every turn a character there gets shocked. This forces them to battle the Emperor off before they can set up their strategy. LS Senate has to worry about the Emperor (V6) too. As soon as Mon Mothma (V9) is killed or Set For Stun is successful on her then the LS Senate is just shut down. When you play this deck, you can decide rather or not you want the Emperor to be an attack force, by going to where the LS is, or as a base for your other cards by placing him in the Throne Room with Emperor's Power (non-V version for adding destiny or V11 version to cause direct damage and power -1 & deploy +1 for Jedi). The Emperor (V6) can be an excellent way to remove characters before battle when you combine his text with the regular Force Lightning to almost auto hit ANY character. Some other ideas that have come out lately involve using the AAT Tanks with the Commander Battle Droid you pull with Endor Shield (V11). The non-unique AATs say you add 2 battle destinies when with a battle droid. So you get out the Back Door with Conduct Your Search, pile up two of them to get 4 destinies and sit on that site. If the LS aren't playing with Quick Draw (V9) or Savrip, they will not be coming to fight you there. The tanks can be great offensive tools too. Just one tank with Emperor's Power would get you 3 battle destiny, plus you can set up the Tauntaun Skull to add another 5 or 6 to power. This makes the tanks an almost auto win to any ground battle. Besides specific ideas for winning battles and causing damage, the basic strategy for BHBM has stayed the same. If you like to battle, and the way this deck feels, then give it a try. It has won many games over the years, but is currently not the strongest option for DS.\\par \\par Why NOT to Play It: The downside to this objective is you are restricted to when you can deploy Vader because as soon as you do, they will automatically get to deploy Luke from their Reserve (or even their lost pile) for Vader to escort. When you have Luke, you will flip and then begin to lose 1 Force from your objective. Losing force for your own cards is not good. Games have single-handedly been lost just because the LS was able to stay away long enough while the objective itself caused the deck to lose. The other problem with this objective is it has a hard time with LS objectives (WHAP and Hyperdrive) that simply get around Your Destiny and never even have Luke in their deck. These objectives don't ever have to worry about you getting the auto victory by crossing Luke. Both those decks can just pile up their characters at one site and wait. Since it never matters how many battles you win, you have to out damage them to have a chance. If your deck isn't built to do enough damage on its own, you will have trouble beating these decks. Heavy space decks can also be a problem. Since the majority of your deck is used for battling on the ground, your space package is always very basic. Just like Huntdown, you usually only have enough space to have presence and battle when needed. Hidden Base with Quads can easily shoot down all your ships and spread out for massive drains. You take the retrieving Luke Skywalker (V1) away but if you can't fight and win in space, you will not be able stop all the drains. Plus your objective would just be hurting you while you are unable to battle. Search & Destroy is another staple for this deck. The most important part is getting them to come to the ground. BHBM is a good deck for a specific meta. It always does well when Luke based decks are running wild.",

    "Rules": "This card only restricts the opponent's use of cards that would place Luke out of play. If a card has multiple functions (one placing a card out of play, and one that does not for example) this objective has no impact on the latter function of the card. Also, if a card targets multiple cards on table, the Light Side player is only prevented from placing Luke out of play. Luke may move away for free if the Lost function of Run Luke, Run (V) is played for example. This is a specific exception to the normal targeting rules.",

Therefore cards that are immune to Alter based on a condition in their game text (such as Come Here You Big Coward) cannot be deployed with this starting interrupt. Cards which are immune to Alter in their game text but can have that immunity canceled by other cards may be deployed using this Interrupt. For example, Prepared Defenses could still be used to deploy Mobilization Points even if Don't Do That Again was on table. When deploying Effects using this Starting Interrupt, each Effect deploys separately, and all automatic actions resolve normally. Thus if this starting interrupt is used to deploy Naboo Occupation, No Escape, and Imperial Arrest Order, Naboo Occupation may be deployed first (and will be immediately lost), followed by No Escape (which allows the dark side player to take the top card of the lost pile into hand) followed by Imperial Arrest Order.",

(Psychobabble)\\par -----\\par Article on DeckTech, August 19th, 2007 '2nd Annual SWCCG Encyclopedia of Decks' by Brandon \"Jabba_the_Ruck\" Ruck\\par http://www.decktech.net/starwarsccg/articles/articles.php?id=6526&view=2\\par \\par Popular Cards to Look For: Luke Skywalker, Rebel Scout (V9) or Jedi Luke, Luke's Lightsaber, I Can't Believe He's Gone (V12), Clash of Sabers, I Feel the Conflict, Jedi, EPPs, Goo Nee Tay, Pod Racing\\par \\par Idea Behind Objective: The first of its kind for LS, an objective that can win the game the moment the seven side is completed. Basically, this objective has the ability to simply win the game if you can figure out how to win 4 battles and the opponent is playing with Vader. You can sometimes win with three if you get a good destiny but 4 is usually the standard (Unless Emperor Palpatine is present, then you need 5). A common mistake with this deck is forgetting to ask for the card to put on I Feel the Conflict once you are victorious in battle. Through the years, this objective has really not changed its strategy. Every version is built pretty much the same way. Common versions of this deck try and find ways to alter power. Power is altered through total battle destiny, total power, or simply lowering the power of the opponent; anything to win the battle. Some of the cards that help to do this include; Jedi Presence, I Can't Believe He's Gone (V12), Clash of Sabers, Smoke Screen, Sorry About the Mess Combo, Aim High (Endor Effect), etc.\\par \\par How It Can Win: This deck wins only if it wins battles. Of course, there are many ways to do this, so you have to be smart with how you build a deck like this. If Vader has Luke, and you have won the required number of battles, you get to shuffle and draw destiny to win any time you want during your turn. It's that simple. The key is playing the right combination of cards that can give you the victory in battle. You only have to get 1 power higher to win any battle and get a card stacked on I Feel The Conflict. Each stacked card adds +3 to the draw total and unlike the similar DS objective Bring Him Before Me, the LS doesn't cause you to lose one 1 while Luke is being escorted. You put the pressure on the DS to come after Luke since you start the game with him already on table with his lightsaber. The LS has many Jedi and powerful Interrupts to make it easy to win battles. This can be done many ways; making your power higher or making the DS's power lower, adding or canceling destiny, removing or excluding DS characters from the battle, or Reacting. Clash of Sabers, Smoke Screen, Don't Forget the Droids (V8), and Artoo I Have a Bad Feeling About This are a few examples of cards that can change the outcome in a battle.\\par \\par What Changed Since 1st Edition: Two big changes happened for this deck. The first one was the change of Scout Luke (V9), who originally said the DS Imperial was forced to move toward Luke while on Endor. Since the Redux, Scout Luke (V9) now says while he is alone at an Endor site, you may retrieve 1 Force during opponent's move phase. Now the LS gets a bonus for Luke being left alone. Unless playing against BHBM, you always want to use this Luke because he also adds one to each of his weapon destinies and require the opponent to pay +1 to fire their own weapons. The second change was I Can't Believe He's Gone (V12). The original version said that it had to be played as a Just action right after Obi was placed out of play. The ability to add +5 to power for 1 Force could be done more than once a turn but was limited to just sites. The new virtual version says that you can play the card at any time after Obi is placed out of play as long as he is no longer on table. The +5 can now be added to any location once per turn for the same 1 Force. If that wasn't enough, the new card also says that while Luke is captive, once per turn at anytime you may activate 1 Force.\\par \\par Why I SHOULD Play It: If you love to battle and be on the offensive side of things, rather than being on the standard defensive, which the LS tends to prefer. This deck can literally pull out a win against what would be an automatic loss. You get to start Luke with his stick before the game has even begun. Now that Qui-Gon and Mace (V9) are around, you have two powerful characters that can be used to battle while Luke is captured. You want to force Vader to be deployed, so it is important to get Luke to any Imperial on the table. If they are playing with no Imperials, then you can use Luke to battle the whole game. The new virtual cards make this objective much stronger than it used to be. Plus with all the new Jedi to play with, there are many ways to fight and win battles over the original meta that existed when this card was made. This is a great deck for beating ground based Imperial decks. It does well against Huntdown, RalOps, Walkers, and Endor Ops as long as you can win some battles. The objective has some direct damage because it says the opponent loses 2 Force a turn while Luke is captured and not with Vader. The DS can't ever battle Luke with an Imperial. Plus it prevents Alien based decks from being able to capture him in fear of losing the 2 Force all game. This is one of those decks where you never know what the player is going to be playing. At Worlds '06, I played against one that started Pod Racing and Goo Nee Tay. Since I wasn't playing any Racing protection, and all my characters were high deploy, this version totally destroyed me. So he was able to win even though he never flipped.\\par \\par Why NOT to Play It: The main reason not to play this deck is that it tends to rely on the opponent playing with Vader to have a good shot of winning. For as long as it has existed, it has had a problem with alien based decks that can simply battle Luke off the table. All of those battles you win will mean nothing. Not only that, but this objective has not been near as powerful with the creation of Darth Maul because he can be played in place of Vader as a character to just throw down and put Luke in the lost pile. Luck comes into play with this deck because you have to win battles to stand a chance and sometimes the difference in a win versus a loss can be decided by just a random destiny draw.\\par The new V cards have really made DS aliens much stronger than any time in the game. There are like four different alien based decks that can give this deck problems. While it might seem appealing getting to win the game after winning 3 to 5 battles, TIGIH is not the best choice for LS.",
