    "Information": "Article on DeckTech, August 19th, 2007 '2nd Annual SWCCG Encyclopedia of Decks' by Brandon \"Jabba_the_Ruck\" Ruck\\par http://www.decktech.net/starwarsccg/articles/articles.php?id=6526&view=2\\par \\par Popular Cards to Look For: Some version of Jabba, Bounty Hunters, Cards that Capture, Independent Starships, Creatures; Rancor or Sarlacc, Den of Thieves (V8), Scum and Villainy, Hidden Weapons\\par \\par Idea Behind Objective: The classic capture objective. This deck was made and groomed to be the best objective for playing with Bounty Hunters who want to capture. The whole idea of the objective is to capture a guy, then feed them to one of your creatures. If the LS stays away from Tatooine all together, they will pay for it. The objective cause 1 card direct damage while a player doesn't have a character present at a Tatooine battleground site. Whenever you finally feed someone to either the Rancor or the Sarlacc, the character is placed out of play, the LS loses Force equal to the forfeit of the character eaten, and the Rancor Pit lets you retrieve Force equal to the same forfeit. At first, this was not that easy because the LS Epps could easily cut through the Bounty Hunters that were trying to capture. Only after the V cards were made did this objective gain a lot of momentum. Cards like Jabba's Influence (V6) to pull aliens and make your Bounty Hunters power +1, Lando (V5) to auto-hit with Hidden Weapons, and Krayt Dragon Bones (V3) which allowed you to keep those creatures under your Starting Effect (Fear Is My Ally) as well as add two additional Ferocity to the Rancor making him a 10 + destiny. All of the alien based decks have gotten better with each Virtual set. There are always new aliens, weapons, or Effects that do more to help the aliens win.\\par \\par How It Can Win: This objective is still one of the BEST retrieval decks the DS has. It wins very easily if the LS is already focused on Tatooine for their strategy; i.e. Profit, WYS (NON V), Hyperdrive, Agents, and any Obi start or CP (V8). It is SO easy for you to both capture and feed any of their characters to the Rancor or Sarlacc that the LS will have trouble deploying their ground on Tatooine. Even if you capture a powerful character like Mace (V9), he can still sit in jail until weaker characters are deployed to try and free him. Currently, this deck has many many options for how it can be built. There are many powerful Bounty Hunters that have no problem capturing any character in the game. The key is to set up the AC with Jabba the Hutt (V8), Scum, and a few friends. Then you wait. You have None Shall Pass (V8), which sends any LS character (except Leia) deploying to a Jabba's Palace site to bottom of the LS Force pile. You can also play Stunning Leader and Barrier to keep your AC crew from getting wiped away. Then on your turn, you drop one of the many options for capturing and try to take away the LS character. Trap Door is played without having to draw destiny (thanks to the objective) to send the captive immediately to the Rancor Pit. Since the Rancor deploys for free from under your starting effect with Krayt Dragon Bones (V3), it can be set up as soon as you deploy the Pit. Once a few LS characters have been eaten and placed out of play, you will usually have no lost pile while the opponent will have fewer characters and have lost Force from the Forfeit of the characters eaten. The other bonus to this deck is it can pull all of your Independent Starships from Reserve, so you are not weak in space either. You can set up Jabba's Space Cruiser (V8), Zuckess in Mist Hunter, Boba Fett in Slave I, Dengar in Punishing One, IG in IG200, and even Maul's Sith Infiltrator. Of course, Maul's ship would have to deploy to a docking bay and shuttle up once you got Maul out. Besides the ships, the objective also pulls docking bays. This means you can still get to any planet the LS is playing on as long as you play with that system's related docking bay. The standard docking bays you will use are usually Hoth, Endor, Cloud City, and the <> from Special Edition which can go to Tatooine, Naboo, Corellia, Datooine, and a ton of others. The majority of LS decks that play on Hoth already play the docking bay which may already be shielded by the Main Power Generators, so you don't usually want to play with that one in that match up. You can also consider leaving out Endor since LS Endor decks are not as popular anymore. Endor can be good for a random battleground for draining and setting up Search & Destroy since it requires the LS to pay +9 to transit there and +7 to transit away. If you come up against a LS deck that has no counters for capturing, you will have a very easy game no matter what their strategy is doing (unless its all space or heavy evasion). Binders can be very powerful in this deck allowing one Bounty Hunter to carry more than one captive at a time. Put one on IG With Gun or 4-Lom With Gun and the LS has no way of fighting the droid to release the captives. Plus you can play Droid Shutdown to protect them from SATM. You can use He's All Yours Bounty Hunter (non V) to transfer a captive from Fett to the droids. Then when the time is right, feed the captive to a creature or put them in jail for a quick 2 Force retrieval per captive thanks to the Jabba's Palace: Dungeon text. Boba Fett SE (V8) is probably the best all around capture character for this deck. He can auto capture with his game text, has a matching weapon that captures adding +2 to capture and +1 to Force Drains while escorting, and also gives you a target for Hidden Weapons which paired with Lando (V5) is either captured or Immediately Lost.\\par \\par What Changed Since 1st Edition: Court has become somewhat popular with the change of the original V8 Scum. The DS can choose to play this deck and capture over playing a beatdown version. The biggest addition to Court was Bounty (V12), which plays on a just captured character, then returns to your hand after retrieving 4 Force when you transfer the character to a prison during your Control phase. This new Bounty can be found either with All Wrapped Up (V8) or with the Fanfare shield since it is now an Immediate Effect. The Dungeon provides an additional +2 retrieval; you get 2 more with Scum, then whatever the forfeit was from the character that was eaten by the Rancor. All of that together makes Court a very powerful option for DS. Besides Bounty (V8), Court got some new characters to play with. The biggest being Aurra Sing (V12). As mentioned already with other decks, this new Aura can relocate to any site with a Jedi during the opponent's activate phase. Then once per game, she can fire a weapon during the opponent's move phase. If you play Quietly Observing, she is ability 0, meaning the LS has no way of getting around her besides SATM (also Han's Gun (V2) or A280 Sharpshooter Rifle (V9), but no one plays with those). You can sit in front of the LS party and use Snipers to capture characters with Feltipern Trevagg's Stun Rifle (V9). This new capture weapon can deploy on any Bounty Hunter and adds +2 to the draw. When you add Hermi Olde (V8), you get another +2 to ANY non-lightsaber, non-permanent character weapon destiny. If you have You Cannot Hide Forever out, it would only take a 3 to capture Mace, Qui-Gon, or Yoda. If you add Lando (V5), then you only need a 2. The final piece would be to give Aurra Sing some Binders so she can hold all of the characters she captures. The rules for relocating say you can't do it while escorting a captive unless the card letting you relocate says so. This is where the docking bays come in so you can get Aurra back to the Dungeon. You can make her trip faster with He's All Your Bounty Hunter (V5) letting her move 2 additional times for free. Establish Control (V11) is great in Court since it already pulls the docking bays. Plus it gets your system for free draining. Another change came in the Advanced Rules document with the changes to creatures. They are not as powerful as they were before the rules change and anyone considering playing this deck should re-read the Advanced Rules document for the creature rules to make sure they know how those cards will play now.\\par \\par Why I SHOULD Play It: The ability to capture is a very very powerful mechanic for the DS. With characters like Mace (V) and Qui-Gon who are completely immune to attrition, it is nice to be able to just take them away from the LS. Capturing is also great for setting up beatdowns. When the LS has two or three characters together at a site, you can capture the stronger ones taking them out of the battle immediately, leaving the weaker character to take battle damage. On top of all of that, you can retrieve your whole lost pile. The objective even provides direct damage for LS decks that stay away from Tatooine. The LS currently has some problems with this deck. If built correctly, most LS decks will not be able handle the many different types of capturing. Besides All Wrapped Up (V8) and Feltipern's Gun (V9), the DS has Hidden Weapons, Boba Fett SE (V8), Fett's Gun (V6), IG's Gun (V5), Dengar's Modified Riot Gun, and IG-88 With Gun. You may not see this at your local tournaments but as time goes on, more and more Court decks will be seen taking out the LS Jedi.\\par \\par Why NOT to Play It: The biggest weakness this deck has is in space because the majority of the deck is ground based around capturing and battling. This decks worst match-up is Hidden Base with weapons since most LS starship weapons have no problem shooting down the Enhanced Bounty Hunter ships. The space package in this deck is usually meant for defense only or getting around Battle Plan/Order only. It will have a problem putting up a fight against most LS space decks. The most popular thing to do is get Maul in Ship going at a system as a way to keep presence in space while still being able to play Scum. Jabba's Space Cruiser (V8) is a standard ship to include since it reacts to bring in a ship and pilot for free. Gela Yeens (V6) is very important if you want to stay alive in space against weapon-based LS space decks. The deck also has problems causing fast damage against decks that it can't fight like MWYHL or Speeders. Since the Speeders protect the characters from capture, they can be hard to beat when you are unable to hit the vehicles with P-59 or Dengar With Gun. Speeders can set up and do damage much faster than Court, and Frostbite (V4) gets back all the cards lost from the direct damage. It is important to play with J'Quille (V8) to get under the shields. MWYHL can shutdown all drains with Test 1, Honor Of The Jedi, and Projection Of A Skywalker. If you come up against the Asteroid version, your ships will not survive and they will be doing 4 to 6 in damage depending on how many they play with.",

    "Information": "Article on DeckTech, August 19th, 2007 '2nd Annual SWCCG Encyclopedia of Decks' by Brandon \"Jabba_the_Ruck\" Ruck\\par http://www.decktech.net/starwarsccg/articles/articles.php?id=6526&view=2\\par \\par Popular Cards to Look For: Some version of Han (Usually Han (V3)), Seeking An Audience (V6), Leia, Rebel Princess, Threepio with Parts Showing, I Must Be Allowed to Speak (V8), See-Threepio (V8), A Gift, Don't Forget the Droids, CZ-3, Padme Naberrie (V11)\\par \\par Idea Behind Objective: Another great movie type objective, putting you right at the beginning of Return of the Jedi. This objective has been very strong since its release in 2000. For years, all it did was change and evolve, and even improved with cards like Leia, Rebel Princess and Seeking an Audience (V6). It has stayed popular because it is a great objective that is centered on the main characters of the movies. This is made clear by the objective causing direct damage for each main character you have at a battleground location, so it even works in space. The whole objective is based around freeing Han from the Jabba's Palace: Audience Chamber. While he is frozen, you can't drain at ANY Tatooine location.\\par \\par How It Can Win: There are many ways to play this deck but for the most part in every version, you will be playing Mains with matching weapons or EPPs. This deck has been known to greatly abuse Civil Disorder (V6) and Mantellian Savrip because you can get Threepio With His Parts Showing out first turn. With Threepio you are consistently putting cards back in your deck to get cards you need. With Han (V3), you are promised totally free retrieval of 5 the moment you flip and also has immunity < 4 in this objective, allowing him to stay alive a bit longer. There are many combos that are made possible by this deck. Some include Boushh, Leia's Blaster Rifle, and Colo Claw Fish, which can KO any character or vehicle early game. Example: Against Walkers, killing Blizzard 4 first turn, while Vader is still on it. This combo is all but gone with the introduction of Frozen Dinner (V11), which cancels Colo Claw Fish. Freeing Han can be done very easily with Someone Who Loves You, which says Han is free if Leia is present at AC, unless playing against Jabba's Prize. Since you can pull Threepio, you can also start Rycar Ryjerd (V2) to pull Hopping Mad (V6). Hopping Mad (V6) may only deploy on a non-Episode I Threepio but can once per turn take into hand Savrip, How Did We Get Into This Mess?, Thank the Maker, and We're Doomed. The original version said that Savrip just couldn't be canceled, but since the Re Edit, it has been changed to just Immune to Alter.\\par \\par What Changed Since 1st Edition: The biggest change to Profit was the downfall of the original post V8 Scum. The original Scum would set up a powerhouse at the AC that could easily beat the snot out of any LS party coming to free Han. With the Errata and Re Edit to the Scum cards, the current Scum is no longer the most popular DS deck. The LS now has the option of playing with See-Threepio (V8). This Threepio has a built-in How Do We Get Out of This Mess? when present with R2. It works as long as Jabba is not on table. So against any DS deck other than Scum, Court, or CCT aliens, you can set up auto HDWGOTM first turn if you also start Cell 2187 (V3) to pull R2. Also, since this Threepio is not Episode I, you can play Hopping Mad (V6) as well. This new combo has become an excellent and powerful strategy for Profit. A version at Worlds '06 I played against was using the CZ-3 droids to react CARDS to same or adjacent sites. Then used Don't Forget the Droids (V8) to either protect ANY droid from being targeted by anything (USED) OR place a droid in battle out of play to prevent opponent from drawing any battle or weapon destinies in that battle (LOST). Since you need to protect Threepio and Artoo anyway, they make nice additions to the basic platform of this objective. Another great addition to Profit is Padme (V11), who provides additional direct damage when Leia or non-Jedi Luke is present at a battleground. Plus, during opponent's control phase, she lets you take into hand any Leia or non-Jedi Luke. When you combine her text with Seeking (V6), you can pull almost every character in the deck. It really works here because she can take into hand Master Luke to deploy for free the very next turn thanks to the objective.\\par \\par Why I SHOULD Play It: Still a nice deck for LS. It has good staying power and can provide consistent damage the whole game. Also, a good platform for early game beatdown with Master Luke since he deploys for free and Chewie, Engraged or a Leia coming down from Reserve deck. Profit has always been a great option for the early game Luke beatdown, which combined a Jedi, Master Luke, Courage of a Skywalker, and Jedi Presence. The beatdown is helped since your objective allows the DS to start the game with two aliens. You automatically have someone to beatdown as soon as you have the cards in your hand. You also don't take drains at the AC while on the zero side. So once you have the combo in your hand, you can drop down everything, clear the AC, and free Han all in the same turn. If done correctly, you can usually cause some good amount of overflow giving you an advantage in the game going forward. With the new combos that can be played with Profit, this deck has become another option for LS. Plus you also have the option of using Krayt Dragon Howl (V8) to start any Obi with matching stick already at the AC to either take on the aliens or free Han first turn should they decide not to deploy any aliens. Of the three types of Obi start decks, Profit is usually the least popular. The other reason to play this deck is for the new IG-88 (V5) deck with CCT. Since it usually takes Jabba's Prize on their first turn, Profit moves JP to the AC. So they don't start the game with a captive for IG. Their whole deck sets up through the searches from IG, so you remove the ability to set up their deck just by playing this objective. They do have ways to capture another character, so you want to make sure when you try to free Han that you are ready.\\par \\par Why NOT to Play It: The DS starting of two aliens can be a problem. Since they also get to go first, they can start EPP Mara Jade (V12) and Dr.E, then add Maul, Emperor (V), Vader (with Blizzard 4 and moving over), etc. Profit almost never uses its first turn to attack the AC, so the DS usually gets 2 to 3 turns of deployment before you have the cards in hand to battle the Forces blocking the AC. You also no longer have the advantage over Jabba's Palace decks since Den of Thieves (V8) allows the DS to raise their converted site by losing 1 Force. The other big problem with Profit is it's very hard to build this deck with strong space. The most common choices include the standard; Home One, Tantive IV (V7), Bright Hope (V5), Spiral, and Gold Leader In Gold 1 (V10). The space package is usually small and relies on the Savrip to stay alive. Since most of the deck is based on the ground and freeing Han, some even choose to just leave out space all together. This means against CCT, that you can't easily free Han since they have Jabba's Prize and they can set up space drains with free Executor. You are taking drains in space while they keep you from draining on Tatooine. Much like Rescue the Princess, this objective rarely wins if it can't free Han. SYCFA Fear is also a big DS deck right now and will deal out too much damage for Profit to win unless they don't play Imperial Decree (V6).",
