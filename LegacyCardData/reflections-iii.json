    "Information": "Article on DeckTech, August 19th, 2007 '2nd Annual SWCCG Encyclopedia of Decks' by Brandon \"Jabba_the_Ruck\" Ruck\\par http://www.decktech.net/starwarsccg/articles/articles.php?id=6526&view=2\\par \\par Popular Cards to Look For: 4 Lord Mauls, 3 Vaders, 2 to 3 Emperors, 2 to 3 Darth Sidious, Force Field, Stunning Leader, Imperial Barrier, and good space.\\par \\par Idea Behind Objective: Just like LS Combat, this objective was very powerful when it first came out. It was very easy for the DS to set up fast and force the LS to stop the drain of 4 produced by Lord Maul and his Double-Bladed lightsaber. For years, this objective could only be stopped by an equally good LS Combat deck or LS Senate. Only until the creation of the V cards did it take a back seat to other much stronger DS options. The PC created a shield to limit who was to be made lost by the objective. I Find Your Lack of Faith Disturbing (V2) for DS and Affect Mind (V2) for LS changed it so that only spies and droids would be lost during your control phase, as well as prevented you from draining for too much by limited the Force drains to only 2 per site if you have two or more Jedi at Naboo sites. It also said the player may only use one Combat card a turn. The shields made this deck more balanced in the tournament environment. The next version to hit the scene was called a 'Shield Buster.' The idea was to get the opponent to play their three Defensive Shields leaving them open to another strategy that they would normally be able to get around with the other Shields. Example, the first sheild they would play was the Combat Shield; from there they may play some combination of the two SAC, grabber, retrieval, Pod Racing shields. Being able to abuse the strategy in your deck that the opponent was no longer able to counter made this version almost unbeatable. If they played their Odds shield, they were left open to SAC or retrieval all game. This version was the main and most powerful version of Combat until the PC created Drop (V8) & Thrown Back (V8), which allow the player to play 4 shields.\\par \\par How It Can Win: The power of DS Combat comes from the fact that there are now many many Jedi for the LS to play with. Since the majority of LS decks play with many different Jedi, you put them in a bind by preventing them from Force draining while not on Naboo. Of course, this means they will have more to throw at you in hopes of killing your Dark Jedi. You have an advantage since your Drains where you have a Dark Jedi can't be canceled and that forces the opponent to come to you in order to win. The majority of the time, unless the LS deck is space based, it will not be able to win if it never comes to Naboo. Many of the most popular LS decks play with Jedi as their main fighting force. So you will be playing against them like 90% of the time. DS Combat has a lot more options for space compared to LS Combat. The majority of them go with matching bounty hunter ships and maybe Baron Fel on Saber 1. You start Combat Response and play 2 to 3 Short Range Combos to set them up fast. This strategy is popular because those ships are pretty cheap and can be set up by second turn after you get Lord Maul down. You also have the option of setting up a Free Executor by just playing Bespin, Mob Points Combo, and TMNALTC. This is a new idea but might work since you need high destiny in the deck to begin with. You can play 2x TMNALTC, 2x We're The Bait (V6), and 3x WMAOPs. The system can be pulled by starting Kuat Drive Yard (V6). The Executor almost never leaves the table once it gets deployed, so you can warrant the slots for the set of Effects you need to deploy it for free. You replace the lower destiny from matching pilots with high destiny Effects and Interrupts. DS Combat is another deck that can work well with Tauntaun Skull. You can play with some high destiny characters like Tech Mo'r or Emperor Palpatine. Tauntaun Skull says you add their destiny number to your total power by placing a copy of that character out of play. You can do some surprise beatdowns on alien based decks or decks that play on Naboo like WHAP. Another aspect of DS Combat that you don't hear about much is Dueling. The objective doesn't prevent you from Dueling as well as playing Lightsaber Combat. You start the game with Deep Hatred already in play, so you will always have a huge advantage Dueling. Most don't think about using this for Combat because it tends to focus around Lord Maul, while Dueling is usually focused around Vader. Since the DS doesn't have as many Dark Jedi to play with, it makes sence to play it. You don't even have to do Epic Duels. You can use old fashioned Circle Is Now Complete or Vader's Obsession against Obi or Luke and add Focused Attack to make sure you win the duel. If they don't play the Affect Mind (V2) Shield or Civil Disorder (V6), the Obsession alone can win games since you can set up a HUGE card Force swing with the Duel damage and the retrieval. You can also use the Dueling cards as Combat cards should you find yourself not wanting to Duel or you are without a Vader.\\par \\par What Changed Since 1st Edition: As mentioned with LS Combat, the powerful 'Shield Buster' version is no longer a viable strategy with this deck since the creation of Thrown Back (V8) and Drop (V8) allowing you to play 4 shields and We Don't Need Their Scum Either (V11) which lets you play another shield from you Starting Effect. Since there is now no limit to the number of shields that one player can play. The original idea for DS Combat is the only real option for this deck. Set up a Dark Jedi and wait. The LS got Obi-Wan Kenobi, Jedi Knight (V11) to play with in LS Combat, while the DS didn't get a new Dark Jedi character. They did get a new stick with Dark Jedi Lightsaber (V12). This means Sidious can now be a powerful Dark Jedi at his own site since, once you make the LS character lost, they can be placed out of play. He didn't seem worth it when he didn't have a stick that was worth playing but now he can be a great addition to DS Combat. Besides the new stick, DS Combat really didn't get much help from new Virtual sets. It remains a decent option for DS but still not the most powerful. The Affect Mind (V2) shield plus Civil Disorder (V6) make this deck open to weaknesses.\\par \\par Why I SHOULD Play It: DS Combat can be a great surprise to a meta that expects the IG-88 deck, DS Senate, Huntdown, or SYCFA Fear. It requires the LS to play completely different than they are used to versus any other DS deck. Remember to always play Much Anger In Him for when you play against LS Combat. Since neither of you will be able to initiate battle and will track the same destinies, they will lose 4 Force a turn. This can be the difference in winning the game and having it timed. Both Combats are probably the one deck where you really need to play both Ability x3 (V6) AND Barriers. In most games you will be playing the Barriers but you still need the Ability x3 (V6) against LS Combat and LS Senate. Since most LS Combat decks play with Civil Disorder (V6), you don't want them to have the advantage. You will almost always win games against decks where they don't have the shield. If they leave you alone, you drain for 3 to 4 all game. Another trick for this deck is to make sure you play 2x DrE (non-combo) and 2x Disarmed. Since you are unable to battle once you flip, it is nice being able to 'operate' on any Disarmed character once you play it during either Control phase. If you played with DrE's gun, he could deploy in front of a Jedi and if they don't play their own Disarmed the following turn, you make them lost during their Control phase. This works very well with DS Senate since you will already be starting Blaster Rack (V1), and you should have a Barrier or Stunning Leader to protect DrE. This can be another way DS Combat can beat LS Combat. DS Combat is a deck where there really isn't a good example of one on Decktech that has won major tournaments. Hopefully as the game continues there will be more options for this objective.\\par \\par Why NOT to Play It: The DS is SOOOO much stronger than the LS right now that there are just too many more powerful options to go with that should be considered before this deck. SYCFA, Senate, and the IG-88 deck are all better options. Plus all the alien based decks can do more damage and give the LS more problems. MWYHL with 2x Projection can hurt too since you will be limited to drains of one at each of your Naboo sites. DS Combat only has Search & Destroy for direct damage, so it can lose against the Asteroid version of MWYHL that does damage without having to come to the ground. DS Combat will always be weak versus space based decks like Hidden base and EBO. The good thing is the Re Edit changed Rebel Planners (V6), so there is no way to cancel the drains on Naboo. This helps versus HB but still doesn't give you the victory. DS Combat never plays enough space to handle all the drains the LS has and some of them can be quite large. So if you come up against a HB that plays ground, you might have problems. You can lose if they knock your space out of the sky and force you to pay for drains. EBO can set up huge drains as well and doesn't take as long to set up. This deck also has to worry about Obi-Wan Kenobi (V8) since he can drain over the objective. Many decks are using Krayt Dragon Howl (V8) to start Obi at the beginning of the game. You don't usually battle with DS Combat, so he can do serious damage if you are unable to kill him early. Remember to try and keep Lord Maul on Naboo, and use Vader or Sidious to fight. New builds might consider a different version of Maul and try leaving Sidious on Naboo for Combat. It is too soon to tell what will be the popular playstyle for this deck. They can simply use Sidious on a lone site to limit the times the LS can play the same Jedi to Naboo. In my experience, DS Combat has not been a very popular option but there may be another amazing build for it that is waiting to be played.",

    "Information": "Article on DeckTech, August 19th, 2007 '2nd Annual SWCCG Encyclopedia of Decks' by Brandon \"Jabba_the_Ruck\" Ruck\\par http://www.decktech.net/starwarsccg/articles/articles.php?id=6526&view=2\\par \\par Popular Cards to Look For: Qui-Gon Jedi Master, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Jedi Knight (V11), Mace Windu (V9), Jedi Knight Luke, HC&F, Sai'Torr Kal Fas (V1), Quick Draw (V9).\\par \\par Idea Behind Objective: Combat was supposed to be the new dueling, giving both sides a way to knock off an opposing Jedi without having to battle. It came out in Reflections 3, the last objective to be released by Decipher before the license was lost. This one was a little broken when it was first released. It allowed you to have protected drains with your Jedi at already large icon sites at Naboo. The broken part was the ability to make ANY non-Dark Jedi character present during the player's Control phase just Lost. That meant it didn't matter who was there, ANY non-Dark Jedi character was just Lost. So from the beginning of this objective, you pretty much had to play with Dark Jedi in order to stand a chance against this deck. This deck played that way until the PC created a Defensive Shield to limit who could be targeted to be made lost by the objective. I Find Your Lack of Faith Disturbing (V2) for DS and Affect Mind (V2) for LS changed it so that only spies and droids would be lost during the Control phase. The card also prevented you from draining for too much by limited the force drains to only 2 if you have two or more Jedi at Naboo sites. It also said the player may only use one Combat card a turn. The shields made this deck more balanced in the tournament environment. The next version of the deck to hit the scene was called a 'Shield Buster.' The idea was to get the opponent to play all their Defensive Shields leaving them open to another strategy that they would normally have been cancelled easily with the other Defensive Shields. An example was when the DS would have to choose between deploying the Combat Shield, then they have two SAC shields, grabber shield, retrieval shields, or Pod Racing shields. Once three of them went down, the deck would set up Odds inserts with the high destiny Jedi in Yoda, MOTF and Jedi Luke. Then you add Screaming Lando for a total of 15 damage from one insert card. Being able to abuse the strategy in your deck that the opponent was no longer able to counter made this version almost unbeatable. If they played their Odds shield, you were left to play your SAC or your retrieval all game. This version was the main and most powerful version of Combat until the PC created Drop (V8) & Thrown Back (V8), which allow the player to play 4 shields.\\par \\par How It Can Win: This deck wins because it has the ability to remove all the Jedi in an opponent's deck and avoid battles, while causing big drains with the high powered Jedi. The deck prevents the DS from every canceling your drains on Naboo while you have a Jedi. So if they don't have a way to come after you, they will not be able to stop the huge drains your deck can produce. The objective forces any DS deck with Dark Jedi to come after you since all Dark Jedi are prevented from draining while not on Naboo. The creation of Mace (V9) created a new aspect for the deck by giving the LS an attack character that could go after the DS while still causing damage on Naboo. It is very easy to set up Combat against a Dark Jedi. Inner Strength allows you to put any card you want under the Jedi that may later be used as the Combat destiny draw, so you are never initiating Combat blindly. The combat is almost an auto-win every time. When the DS loses the Combat, they lose 2 Force, which can't be reduced. The Dark Jedi is lost if the difference is greater than 5 and the loss has to come from Reserve deck. If Qui-Gon, Jedi Master was the Jedi that initiated it, the DS has to lose an additional 2 Force. This means that in one swift stroke, the DS lost one of their Dark Jedi and 4 cards blind from Reserve. You may only initiate Combat during your move phase, so every deck relies on evasion cards to prevent the Dark Jedi that come to Naboo from battling your Jedi off the table. Rebel Barrier, It's a Trap, Blast the Door Kid, and Dodge are all very popular in Combat decks. Once the attacking Dark Jedi is stopped, the next turn you set up Combat and bye bye Dark Jedi. Then wait for the next Dark Jedi and repeat. The idea of the deck is very basic because you never really have to do anything. Once you set up, if the DS has no way of hurting your drain and stays away from you, you will usually win the game while having put few cards on the table. You can always setup On The Edge with Flash of Insight (V5) or by tracking. The deck also plays SAC for getting around bothersome Effects and Interrupts.\\par \\par What Changed Since 1st Edition: The new Virtual sets have changed how LS Combat is played. Cold Feet (V11) allows the DS to play another Defensive Shield a turn, so the 'Shield Buster' version is no longer an option. Now the deck uses Obi-Wan, Jedi Knight (V11) as one of the main Combat characters. The original virtual version of Obi, JK was made WAY too powerful and allowed you to cancel ANY destiny drawn by the DS while at same site as a Dark Jedi. This included battle, weapon, duel, combat, Ellis, SAC, shock, or choke destiny. For Combat alone, Obi could auto-win any Combat since it was always 2 draws to 1. His text was changed in the Re Edit to use 1 Force to cancel a battle, duel, or weapon destiny against a Dark Jedi, leaving Combat to the way it was originally meant. The edition of this new Obi has given the basic idea of LS Combat new light. Both Obi (V11) and Mace (V9) have made the deck a very popular option for the LS in the current tournament environment. Let's Keep A Little Optimism Here (V11) also works very well in the deck by forcing the DS to come after the Jedi to get around the drain being reduced to one.\\par \\par Why I SHOULD Play It: The idea of Combat can be very powerful if you know how to play it. You automatically have an advantage over any DS deck that relies on Dark Jedi to win. Huntdown, BHBM, DS Combat, DS Senate, and random Bespin or Endor decks can have trouble with Combat forcing them to attack the Jedi or lose the game. Dueling Huntdown has a better game compared to non-dueling since they can duel off the Jedi and cause 9 Force loss for each one, but the standard Combat will play What Was It? and at least 2 copies of A Jedi Resilience. Just remember to grab the Circle Is Now Complete to limit the number of duels they will get off because it isn't unique and can be played multiple times a turn. Against DS Combat you can use Civil Disorder (V6) to limit their own Combat destiny and remove their combat cards, so if they don't play Ability x3 (V6) themselves, you will automatically have the advantage. When Combat plays the mirror-match against each other, the game is usually timed since neither side is able to initiate battle. The DS has a small advantage because they have Much Anger In Him to cause the LS to lose 4 Force each turn the Jedi doesn't battle. Versus DS Senate, you should have almost an auto-win if you include Scrabbled Transmission (V5) to remove their Political Effects. Without the PEs, Senate will not be able to beat the immunity to attrition Jedi that cause huge drain damage. Plus most DS Senate decks are space based, so if you remove their PEs, they will not be doing as much damage as you are. The hardest match-ups for LS Combat are any DS alien decks because they are not affected by your objective. If your Jedi get captured or beatdown by heavy aliens it can be hard to win. You can still make any Spy or Droid lost with the objective when the DS has the Shield out, so you don't have to worry about 4-Lom, IG-88, P-59, or Mara as long as you can cancel the battle. If they don't have the Shield, you will have a huge advantage making all their characters lost when they come to Naboo.\\par \\par Why NOT to play it: Combat has come and gone over and over in a cycle as each V set has come out. Currently you can see it being played but it does have weaknesses. The biggest weakness is SYCFA Fear because their entire deck is in space and does heavy direct damage with drain damage against a usually small LS space package. The majority of LS Combat decks don't play with many ships. You will usually only see HC&F, Artoo In Red 5, Gold Leader in Gold 1 (V10), Tantive IV (V7), Spiral, Bright Hope (V5) or even Home One. The destiny should remain high when the deck is built, so you don't want to play a lot of the lower destiny starships. The other reason Combat is not as popular is the DS alien decks that also seem to come and go in a cycle. CR (V8) Scum, Court, Black Sun, and MKOS all have ways to fight the Jedi and do solid damage on their own. Since you never have any Dark Jedi to fight, the deck becomes an old fashion mains and toys with you having to keep Jedi alive to win. Usually being able to keep Savrip alive and retrieving a few key cards will be enough to defeat the aliens but you need to wait until you have the Sense for Masterful Move, then make sure to grab that card so it can't be played again. In the end of the duel for Savrip, it should stay alive giving you a way around their power. This card can also be the difference in SYCFA Fear.",
