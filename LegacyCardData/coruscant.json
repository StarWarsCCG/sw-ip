For example, Baragwin says \"Once per turn, if the top card of your Lost Pile is a weapon, device or transport vehicle, may use 1 Force to retrieve it.\" If there is at least one Interrupt or Utinni Effect stacked upon Do They Have A Code Clearance?, that will reduce the Baragwin retrieval from 1 card to no cards.

    "Information": "Light Side counter against Dark Side Senate is Scrambled Transmission (V5)\\par -----\\par Article on DeckTech, August 19th, 2007 '2nd Annual SWCCG Encyclopedia of Decks' by Brandon \"Jabba_the_Ruck\" Ruck\\par http://www.decktech.net/starwarsccg/articles/articles.php?id=6526&view=2\\par \\par Popular Cards to Look For: 3 to 4 Lott Dod, 7 to 10 other Senators, 2 to 3 Squabbling Delegates, all 4 political Effects, Naboo system\\par \\par Idea Behind Objective: Much like LS Senate, this objective was a broken strategy for multiple years. This deck has stayed powerful even after LS Senate had dropped off with The Emperor (V6) making it too hard to play. DS Senate didn't have to fear any such character. Even with the creation of over five V cards that hurt DS Senate, the deck still seemed to find a way to win. Despite not getting the awesome ability of Queen Amidala, RON, the deck has a different ability. Lott Dod is by far the strongest of all DS Senators letting you take any card from Force pile into hand just like Keeping the Empire Out Forever and IG-88 (V5), only it is limited to your Control phase only. In other decks, this is a strong ability but in Senate it is pretty much broken because it provides you with a Senator any time you need one and allows you to react to the LS while still using all of the Political Effects to make things go your way in battle. Even though V cards can be played to counter this deck, the LS has to play those cards and those cards are totally useless against any other match up. Ds still finds ways to win even when those V cards are used. DS Senate is a great platform for many different kinds of decks because each Senator does something to hurt the LS or help the DS. Besides Lott Dod, you have Baskol Yeesrim to cause direct damage for each Naboo location you control. Aks Moe makes all your capital ships power +2 and drain +1. Orn Free Taa lets you take a card just drawn for destiny into hand (if it's a Senator, you can then be placed on your Politcal Effect, yep this is legal), and he can go back in your deck. Passel Argente makes opponent's non-unique vehicles and starships each deploy +2 and power -1. Tikkes says you get +2 Force generation at battlegrounds you control and suspends Honor of the Jedi. Yeb Yeb Adem'thorn says during your turn you may peek at opponent's Reserve deck, use 1 Force to place the card in Used pile or lose 1 Force to make it lost. Since you only have to have two Senators to stay flipped, you usually have Lott Dod with one of the other ones. If your strategy requires the use of another Senator, then you find him with Squabbling Delegates and save the rest to be placed on the PEs.\\par \\par How It Can Win: Just like LS Senate, DS Senate wins by playing cards that can battle and do damage on their own combined with the power of the Political Effects to make the pain even worse. The standard set up for this deck is pretty much the same. Set up the Galactic Senate with a Lott Dot and another Senator and flip. The most popular builds of this deck will deploy the Tatooine: Desert Landing site if the LS started a system. They usually start Naboo if the LS doesn't start a system. The majority of the deck is space with matching ships with the ground being EPP Maul and EPP Vader. The standard for the space package is to use matching pilot ships like Zuckess (V7) with Mist Hunter (V5), Baron Fel with Saber 1, Bossk (V5) with Hound's Tooth (V5), and either Dengar (V5) with Punishing One (V5) or Boba Fett (non-V) with Slave I (V7) since he deploys as a react for free. The matching ships all have high immunity to attrition, when you combine them with the PEs, they are also impossible to kill. The space will invade the system and usually disrupt the strategy. If the LS is playing a ground based deck, you start Naboo to set up the space asap. The PEs allow you to cancel a Force drain, adds +3 to just drawn battle destiny, subtracts -3 from just drawn opponents destiny, and adds +2 to your Force drain. Besides the initial ability from placing a Senator on the Political Effect, each PE provides an additional ability when a senator is already stacked there. Accepting Trade Federation Control allows you to activate 1 Force during your draw phase, while opponent has to use 1 Force (if possible). Motion Supported lets you, once per turn, lose your just drawn destiny to substitute one from hand. Our Blockade Is Perfectly Legal allows once during your turn to cancel a 'react' or an attempt by opponent to move away from battle which can be huge versus QMC. This is Outrageous! allows you to place a card from hand in lost pile to shuffle and take the top card into hand. If the LS don't play counter cards for DS Senate, they will not be able to win very easily.\\par \\par \\par What Changed Since 1st Edition: The main idea of DS Senate is the same as it was before any v-sets were made. None of the newer virtual cards have done all that much to affect what this deck does. Even the Re Edit seemed to have no affect on this deck. A few characters like EPP Mara (V12) make it better by providing a spy with a built in weapon. Plus you have new options with the Stinger (V12) and Guri in space as a matching pilot ship. The Re Edit did change what LS decks this deck has to worry about. Speeders used to be a difficult game if the LS could stay alive at the Hoth system. Now Speeders is much slower than it used to be, so it is almost impossible to take back Hoth before the DS has total control. WYS (V8) was also a hard match-up for this deck but now doesn't even exist anymore. With the change of the V cards, more Obi start decks have come to life. One with Agents and one in WYS, which can both set up huge drains from turn one. DS Senate is a great counter for these decks because you have the PE that cancels drains that can be set up first turn if you are able to flip depending on your opening hand.\\par \\par Why I SHOULD Play It: DS Senate is still a very popular choice for DS. At any major tournament, there will always be at least one. The PEs makes the deck very powerful but the objective is also another reason to play this deck. Since this deck is so easy to flip, you usually have no problem first turn by getting Lott Dod and another senator together as long as the LS doesn't start Civil Disorder (V6) to add +2 to the deploy cost of the Senators. The seven side makes all your Senators either destiny +2 or +3 when drawn for weapon or battle destiny. This makes the destiny in the deck very very good since all the Senators become destiny 5 or 6 and are constantly recycling. The objective also allows you to pay 3 Force and place 2 random cards from opponent's hand in used pile. When you add a few Defensive Fires, you can remove 3 cards in one turn from the opponent's hand, greatly changing the possibilities of the LS. All the PEs can be pulled by the objective and the only way to flip back is if the DS has fewer than two Senators at the Senate. You have no fear of weapons in the Senate since the objective adds +6 to each draw. You can even play a Coruscant Guard to make any character without politics forfeit 0. Once you build the main deck with Senators, PEs, 2 to 3 Squabblings, and Senate Hovercam; the rest of the deck can be just about anything. You can build a ground-based version around the AAT Tanks or use capital ships with Aks Moe since you get power +2 and Drain +1. I even played around with a deck that set up the Death Star docking bay with Reegesk (V3). When the LS came after him, you drop Lt Suba with multiple Stormtrooper Garrisons for free for a game ending beatdown. The possibilities are endless since you can search your Force pile and add/subtract to multiple aspects of the game. DS Senate will always be an option for DS even with the counter cards.\\par \\par Why NOT to Play It: The main reason to stay away from DS Senate is the many counter cards that have been made throughout the different Virtual sets. The main ones are Scrambled Transmission (V5), Leia (V3), and Civil Disorder (V6). Scrambled Transmission (V5) protects the LS from removing cards while you have less than 13 cards and allows the LS to lose 2 Force to cancel any Political Effect. This can be huge since they can wait until you have a Senator on one then make it lost so the loss in Force is equal for both sides. Since most DS Senate decks only retrieve when they play Squabbling Delegates, it is almost impossible to get back the PEs once the LS makes them lost. Leia (V3) lets you place any Senator out of play (as well as herself) by losing 1 Force. The LS can wait until the Senate deck sets up to decide which Senator to place out of play. Sometimes the LS will choose Tikkes or Baskol over Lott Dod if their strategy sets up a lot of direct damage or has no way of holding three battlegrounds to get around HOTJ. Civil Disorder adds two to the deploy cost of each of your senators making it hard to flip first turn which slows the deck down. Another counter is the Coruscant Alter which can target the PEs. Since they are Lost Interrupts, they don't get used much with the SAC shields sending the PEs back into the Reserve deck. The counter cards don't mean auto victory for the LS but they do change how powerful the Senators can be. The game can be tough for the DS when the opponent plays with all three counters; Scrambled Transmission (V5), Leia (V3), and Civil Disorder (V6). The most popular decks that play ST (V5) are Combat and TRMs but you might see them in any LS deck if DS Senate is expected.",

    "Information": "LS counters against the Watto Objective are:\\par \\par Scrambled Transmission (V5)\\par The Professor (V9)\\par -----\\par Article on DeckTech, August 19th, 2007 '2nd Annual SWCCG Encyclopedia of Decks' by Brandon \"Jabba_the_Ruck\" Ruck\\par http://www.decktech.net/starwarsccg/articles/articles.php?id=6526&view=2\\par \\par Popular Cards to Look For: 3 to 4 Wattos, Executor, Maul With Stick or Tatooine Maul, battle evasion cards\\par \\par Idea Behind Objective: This objective is very different from the other darkside objectives because just like Hyperdrive for LS, it is completely designed around playing at just two sites; the Junkyard and Mos Espa. Of course, the Junkyard is the same site that Hyperdrive has to defend. Unlike Hyperdrive though, the DS is NOT restricted on what characters they can play with. This deck can be built with any number of Imperials or alien forces. For years this objective was a very solid strategy allowing the DS to either cause direct Force loss for 2 or get to play ANY card they want for free. The DS Junkyard with Watto present is also a very powerful site by preventing the LS from drawing ANY battle destinies. So the only way for the LS to knock them off the site is to get lucky with their weapons. The downside to this deck is the LS can simply put Watto back in their deck just by using 8 Force. This will let the DS retrieve 4 Force but if they should get Watto of of the Junkyard early, it can have a major affect on how the deck plays out. Watto is the key to the deck and must be protected for the deck to work. Besides the ability to deploy cards for free or cause the direct damage of 2 Force, the objective doesn't do much. It does say that opponent's non-unique aliens are EACH deploy +3. When you combine that with the Death Star Sentry Shield adding +X for each non-unique character deploying to same site, Watto auto wins versus alien decks that focus on those characters. AITC with non-unique aliens doesn't have a prayer. The deck wins because it puts a solid hold on the Junkyard, which is very hard to disrupt. The reason Watto wins is because the best builds focus on setting up a fortress at the Junkyard and then setting up on Mos Espa and the system. You set up Tatooine Occupation for additional damage and just wait. The main deck doesn't do a lot of damage but starts the damage early in the game and has the ability to fight off the LS consistently all game.\\par \\par How It Can Win: This objective puts the pressure on the LS by forcing them to come to fight Watto early unless the LS strategy can set up and do a lot of damage without the DS being able to stop it. The normal strategy with this deck is to deploy Watto with the Junkyard text. Always deploy use the once per game first even if you have one in your hand since you will most likely need to redeploy him again. Then play a characters like Ephant Mon to Mos Espa with Power of the Hutt or Admiral Ozzel with Endor Shield (V11). This will flip the objective and most of the time, you could sack the Mob Points Combo you were starting with to pull Carida, Rendelli, or Executor, and find Search and Destroy for yet another Force loss. Some new versions choose to play with Crossfire (V9) and pull the Occupation since you are getting the added destiny. You can use Watto's text to find his Chance Cube and then use it as the card you place in used pile for the 2 Force loss since, in the majority of games, the LS will not have the Force saved on their first turn. Just makes sure to not give up too many searches with Thrown Back (V8). The majority of the time, the LS will not be able to deploy anything worthwhile on their first turn to fight Watto. So you can take the next turn to fortify the Junkyard and set up in space. You can play with Kuat Drive Yards (V6) to pull the system. It is very important to never pay for drains with this deck because you should always be using Force for more deployment or your red stuff. The deck always plays evasion. The most common is Imperial Barrier. When you combine Barrier with regular DrE, you can set up Disarmed the following turn. Remember you can deploy cards for free with your objective if the LS pays the 2 Force, so the trick is to wait until you believe they will put down the Executor. Never put down a red card while they have Force saved unless you are feeling lucky. The best strategy is to always just lose the 2 Force and try and get around the direct damage with HOTJ or Imperial Atrocity (V6). This prevents the DS from ever deploying stuff for free as well as forcing them to put some key characters and ships back into their deck. A very powerful card in Watto is Broken Concentration because it allows you to pay 2 Force and move the top card in opponent's Force pile to the top of their Reserve deck. If you keep Force saved, it requires the LS to save 4 Force at the end of their turn. This can be very hard mid to late game when they deploy stuff, battle, retrieve, and still need to draw cards.\\par \\par What Changed Since 1st Edition: At first, Watto was not seen very much with the creation of Thrown Back (V8) since the most popular versions could search 4 to 5 times their first turn, thus providing the 2 Force for the LS to pay at the very beginning of the game. Since the deck needs the direct damage to win, players were staying away. Once more V cards were made, the deck had more options for setting up, attacking, and defending that it didn't have previously. Endor Shield (V11) provides the deck with another option for pulling the second character to go at Mos Espa over the original Power of the Hutt. Luke, Luke (V11) also provides the deck with a way to protect against some drains and force the LS to come after them at the Junkyard. EPP Mara (V12) gives the deck another EPP to help fight off the Jedi that come calling. Plus the overall change to what the LS are playing has made Watto a popular option. TRMs is no longer the deck it used to be with Wipe Them Out, All of Them (V9) but don't expect to never see TRMs either. Speeders no longer gets 2x T-47 Battle Formation and can take two extra turns to flip. Some new ideas for Watto include setting up the AATs with Commander Battle droids pulled by Endor Shield (V11). They add two destiny and their cannons can fire at adjacent sites. You can set one up at Mos Espa and hold it all game with no worry. If you don't want to go with all the cards for the Tanks, you can choose to play multiples of Blizzard 4 since it is power 8 and pulls an Imperial warrior each time it is deployed. Since the Junkyard is a much harder option to go after, most players will choose to go after Blizzard 4 at Mos Espa. When you add Crossfire (V9) destiny and any additional power from the system, they lose stuff while you just deploy another copy of Blizzard 4. Watch out for Heroic Sacrifice (V4) taking away your destiny and causing you to lose a 1 a turn to keep it in play as well as Mechanical Failure causing a huge beatdown. It's always a good idea to play at least one Ghhhk in the deck for that random time the LS gets lucky against either Watto or Blizzard 4.\\par \\par Why I SHOULD Play It: The deck is much like Hyperdrive in the sense that it does the same thing each game and simply hangs out on one or two sites. So because of that, you will not have to think that much to play this deck. Most of the time you are just battling at either Mos Espa or the Junkyard and don't have to go the opponent's sites. The great thing about the power of this objective is you can flip it back at the end of your turn. Then on your next turn, deploy another character to Mos Espa to flip it and either cause the 2 Force loss or get a card out for free. Always make sure you are paying attention to your opponent's Force pile because this deck allows you to get cards back in your deck that normally would be stuck in your hand. If your opponent doesn't have any force or maybe just 1 saved, then you can put ANY card you want down with no fear. If they do have a lot of force, then you would be safe to put a high deploy card like the Executor down as that player could choose to pay and not lose the force. Then you get that Executor out for free. The reason Watto can be hard to beat is the LS usually gives up their own strategy to come after the Junkyard. The whole deck is built to fight and protect that site, so the LS is doing exactly what you want them to do. The deck can set up a lot of direct damage that is tough for the LS to handle. MWYHL doesn't usually stand a chance if Broken Concentration gets out early and you start hitting them with early damage. When playing Watto, make sure to know when to go after the LS and when to hold back and wait for them to come to you. You can get stuck wasting attack forces leaving Watto to the wolves on the following turn. The majority of Watto decks require more red cards to attack and defend over cards with ability.\\par \\par Why NOT to Play It: Watto is a different kind of deck to play. It does do the same thing every game but the options for fighting having you choosing between going to the LS locations or waiting for them to come after you. It usually takes a higher skilled player to win consistently with this deck. When you come up against Thrown Back (V8), you have to be careful in how many searches you give up. Plus the same card that hurts DS Senate also hurts Watto. Scrambled Transmission (V5) lets the LS peek at the card you put down so they know if you try and bluff a red card when they have the force saved. If Speeders can set up and start doing a lot of damage as well, you can have a tough game. The Speeders objective will only require them to lose 1 Force, so if they play Scrambled Transmission (V5), they will know when to pay the Force and when to just lose 1. Since you don't have a huge space package, you usually have problems with Hidden Base. Tat Maul + Ship with Security Precautions does help but the new versions of Hidden Base that play starship weapons can easily shoot down the ship as soon as they hit the table. Watto can get locked down by Hidden Base very easily. TRMs can be tough as well since Watto doesn't activate much Force. They will usually have more characters than you and SAC can hurt if it ends up getting Watto killed more than once. EBO and LS Senate can also be tough since they can set up HUGE drains in space pretty early. Watto can be a very awesome deck for DS but you really have to know what you are doing to make it work.",

For one thing, it is difficult to get both the character and his matching weapon into play together without packing extra copies of both cards.

Finally, most weapons don't have the extra damage that lightsabers can cause through Force drains. Panaka's Blaster looks to be the weapon that bucks the binder fodder trend.\\par \\par Panaka's Blaster can easily get on the table, since Captain Panaka's game text allows you to deploy a blaster from your Reserve deck. That solves the problem of getting the weapon out where it will do some good. It also has a very respectable chance of hitting a target, requiring a weapon destiny +2 greater than the target's defense value. Of course, the weapon destiny draw can be boosted with cards like Blaster Proficiency.\\par \\par Beyond these basic characteristics, Panaka's Blaster has two more things going for it. First, if the blaster hits a target in a battle, the Light Side's total power in that battle is +3. The final bonus comes from game text on Captain Panaka: if Panaka hits a character with a blaster, your opponent has to lose 2 Force. This text is an interesting bit of direct damage that encourages the Light Side to battle early and often.\\par \\par And for those players who really miss the Force drain bonus of lightsabers, there's always the used interrupt Rebel Artillery, which causes a 1 Force loss at a site you control where a non-lightsaber weapon is present.

If you are protecting her with an appropriately armed Qui-Gon (who is now defense value 8!), then that saber will be adding to the Force drain insult.\\par \\par With that sort of damage, suddenly your opponent is being forcibly diverted from more important tasks (like flipping his objective) as he is comitted to throwing resources to defend what was only going to be a site for a little force-generation. That may well tilt the game your way.\\par \\par So with this wonder woman on your side, what do you have to fear? Weapon fire and attrition are the biggest threats, as Gandish may very well be the only one of your characters at that location who is not immune. As for weapons, sabers will paint her with a big target sign, and 4-LOM may very well find her to be a firm favorite in his targeting reticle. If you want to play sneaky, put her inside a vehicle for a little weapon and choke protection, perhaps even aboard a Rogue Squadron snowspeeder for some immunity as well (if you can get the appropriate pilot aboard). Remember, she will still be working her magic, and also adding 2 power - more than she would if left exposed on the ground.\\par \\par Keep an eye out for this great gal! You're going to be seeing a lot of her. And remember, beware the double-edged sword that is the unattended docking bay!",

    "Information": "Article on DeckTech, August 19th, 2007 '2nd Annual SWCCG Encyclopedia of Decks' by Brandon \"Jabba_the_Ruck\" Ruck\\par http://www.decktech.net/starwarsccg/articles/articles.php?id=6526&view=2\\par \\par Popular Cards to Look For: 3 to 4 Queen Amidala Ruler of Naboo, 8 to 10 other Senators at least 2 or 3 must be Senator Palpatine and one must be Mon Mothma (V9), Strike Planning, 2 to 3 Might of the Republic, Threepio with Parts Showing, all four Political Effects(PEs), Coruscant: Jedi Council, HC&F, Senate Hovercam, EPPs, Entrenchment (V9)\\par \\par Idea Behind Objective: LS Senate was originally a broken strategy that took a few years off and has now been made strong again with the introduction of Mon Mothma (V9). When the objective was first released, it was not that strong or even played that much. It was only after Reflections 3 that it became a super powerhouse with the introduction of Shields and Han, Chewie & The Falcon. The deck went on what seemed to be an endless winning streak that only seemed to stop when The Emperor (V6) was released. The only deck that had a chance against it was DS Senate, though the LS had an advantage with the Queen getting to be placed unlimitedly on a Political Effect as long as it was affecting separate actions (one per destiny draw and one per force drain). The deck was a machine that, with all its many parts, was not an easy deck to play. The main reason LS Senate is so powerful is because of Queen Amidala, Ruler of Naboo. She is not a Senator but says she can still be played on the Politcal Effects while a Senator is currently not there. Since it doesn't say she can't already be there, you have the option of playing more than one Amidala on the same PE for cancelling multiple Force drains or during the same battle. So if you are able to draw three battle destinies, you would be able to play two Amidalas plus a Senator to add +9 to your total. Of course, you can also do the opposite to the DS and subtract from their destinies when they get more than one battle destiny. DS Senate has no way to put more than one Senator on any PE during the same turn, so the fact that the LS can put multiples in one turn gives them a HUGE advantage. Besides Amidala, the LS has many powerful Senators that each provide a special ability in the game. The main one that you always want in the Senate is Senator Palpatine because he says you may use 1 Force to add an opponent's battle destiny to your total power. Horox Ryyder prevents the opponent from drawing more than one battle destiny at battleground systems, while also preventing you from canceling it. Tendau Bendon says if you have at least one card in hand, once during your Control phase may place hand in Used pile to draw up to four cards from Reserve. Yarua lets you retrieve 1 Force when you initiate a battle at a battleground system. Liana Merian says once during opponent's turn, you may target opponent's just drawn battle destiny; opponent must use or lose 2 Force or that destiny = 0. Each Senator can totally change how powerful the DS can be in battle.\\par \\par How It Can Win: This objective wins because the Senators and Political Effects provide the ability to alter whatever the DS is doing. You can turn an EPP into a work horse when attacking a site. The PEs allow you to cancel a Force drain, add +2 to your Force drain, add +3 to a just drawn battle destiny, and subtract -3 from opponent's just drawn battle destiny. Besides the initial ability of each PE, each one has an added ability while a specific type of Senator is placed on them. Ascertaining The Truth says during your move phase, you may peek at the top 2 cards of any Reserve deck and replace them in any order. I Will Not Defer allows you once per turn to activate 2 Force when opponent initiates a battle. Plea To The Court lets you cancel a just drawn weapon destiny to cause a re-draw in battles where opponent has a weapon and you do not. It abuses cards like A Jedi's Resilience to get the Epps right back into hand. The Gravest of Circumstances says that during your turn, you may place any card in Used pile to cause opponent to use or lose 1 Force. When you combine each of these PEs with the power of the Senators, the DS can not win any battle easily. Horox for example says the DS gets only one battle destiny in battles at battleground systems. He says you can't cancel that destiny but the PEs are not canceling the destiny when they are reducing their draw. So the DS should not be able to ever get a battle destiny draw above 4 since you can make it -3. This means if you play with starships that are immune <5, you can never have your immunity to attrition broken through. This makes LS Senate is a very powerful option for LS space decks, much like DS Senate.\\par \\par What Changed Since 1st Edition: First, Mon Mothma (V9) allows you to pull your drain location since LS Senate almost always starts the Jedi Council Chamber. The Re Edit added a new ability to Mothma (V9) for use in LS Senate. She allows you to take into hand a just drawn card for battle destiny (if it's a senator, you can then place in on a PE during that battle, yes this is legal). This deck now has a few options with how it can be played. The Re Edit also changed the original Entrenchment (V9) into a completely different card. Now Entrenchment (V9) deploys on a site and says the LS ALWAYS get the first weapon phase action as well as gives all your characters there defense value +1. So when you have the Theed Palace: Core with Mace (V9) and stick, you ALWAYS send the ability <5 characters to used pile. Since you are playing Senate, you have the ability to reduce their destiny and add to yours. Combine all of that with Palpatine adding their destiny to your total and there is almost no way to remove Mace. Set up Tawss Khaa (V7) and you drain for 5 to 6 all game unless the DS can set up Resistance. You start Wokling (V3) to pull either the Hovercam or Entrenchment (V9) depending on what you play against.\\par \\par Why I SHOULD Play It: The Emperor (V6) made this deck very hard to win with because he could drop down and just auto kill anyone who showed up at the senate. There was no way around this for years after he was released until Mon Mothma (V9) came out. She alone allows you to flip that much faster since she is pulled with Strike Planning and prevents the Emperor (V6) from 'shocking' anyone while she is there. If that wasn't enough, she also lets you pull a battleground, whereas before you had to draw or play cards that could pull them. The deck has been given a new birth in the current tournament scene. Senate can be very hard to play against and can stay alive for a long time while altering what the DS is doing. LS Senate has a great advantage over DS Senate because there is no Scrambled Transmission (V5) canceling the PEs and protecting the removal of cards with the objective. The only way the DS can totally cancel the PEs is if they play Alter from Coruscant, which is a lost Interrupt. If you play Wise Advice, you can just re-pull that cancelled PE next turn and it will never leave the table again. They do have Hyperwave Scan (V3) but it just says the PEs go to used pile for 3 Force and only during the LS turn. Since LS Senate is never the most popular choice at tournaments, you will almost never come across ANY of the counters besides The Emperor (V6). As LS Senate begins to become more popular, the creation of a DS version of Scrambled Transmission (V5) may come to pass.\\par \\par Why NOT to Play It: Because The Emperor (V6) still exists, all the DS has to do now is Set for Stun Mon Mothma (V9) and then shock two characters away before she can come back down. It might be a good idea to play more than one Mothma (V9) just in case. Black Sun can give this deck problems since they have so much forfeit in space, retrieval when they battle with Scum and can pull The Emperor (V6) from Reserve first turn. The deck has no real protection from beatdown aside from playing with Houjix. The newest versions have to rethink EPPs with the creation of Wipe Them Out, All of Them (V9) in the Redux. If you are not in control over a battleground site, then your EPP weapon draws are -2 EACH. Since half the deck is going toward the Senators, it can have problems against SYCFA Fear when that deck starts doing a lot of direct damage and playing enough power that they can knock your ships out of space. Another weakness this deck has is Monnok. Many times in a game, this deck will have doubles of Amidala in hand ready to be placed on the Political Effects. Nothing hurts more then having to toss them to a Monnok played during the DS's control phase before they drain. On a side note to the weaknesses with this deck, the LS Senate deck is the MOST EXPENSIVE deck to build in the current SWCCG universe because the deck is made with a large majority of the rarest Coruscant cards. Coruscant is the most expensive set. You will be looking at throwing down a good amount of money if you didn't already own enough of the cards. Since there aren't really any counters for the LS PEs, this deck should get more popular.",

    "Information": "Article on DeckTech, August 19th, 2007 '2nd Annual SWCCG Encyclopedia of Decks' by Brandon \"Jabba_the_Ruck\" Ruck\\par http://www.decktech.net/starwarsccg/articles/articles.php?id=6526&view=2\\par \\par Popular Cards to Look For: Master Qui-Gon (V12), Mace Windu (V9), A Remote Planet, Han's Dice (V2), Queen Amidala, random Aliens and Republic characters\\par \\par Idea Behind Objective: This objective has not seen much action until recent years. Following the same trend as others before, the objective was too slow and not that effective to be worth playing. Only after new V cards were released has it become even a choice for LS. The main idea is to get out a powerful Jedi, i.e Obi, Qui-Gon, or now Mace (V9) to the Junkyard and do what you can to keep the DS off the site long enough for you to drain 4 times there or win enough battles so that you will collect cards on Credits Will Do Fine and flip the objective. Once flipped, it can't flip back but doesn't really do that much to be worth it. There are a lot of cool things that the seven side could do, the main one is getting to retrieve a card directly into hand WHENEVER you draw a battle destiny.\\par \\par How It Can Win: This deck can win because the strategy of the objective is literally the easiest one to play of all the objectives. All you have to do is get out a good size party with Undercover protection and Tawss Khaa (V7) at the Junkyard. Then you just hit them for 3 to 5 card loss ALL game. That is it. You of course can build a version to do more than that but you really don't have to. You are already hurting in both the space and ground departments, so the best way to build this deck is to base it around that lone strategy, any other will make it more difficult to win. Queen Amidala is a good addition to this deck because she adds +2 to defense value of every Republic character in your deck.\\par \\par What Changed Since 1st Edition: The biggest change was the discovery of a new way to play this deck. The objective allowing you to retrieve cards when you draw destiny has been ruled to work when you REDRAW destiny as well. The current version of this deck sets up Depa so you always get at least one Redraw a turn. Then you add Han's Dice (V2) which says; Once per turn, if just drawn for destiny, may take this Interrupt into hand to cancel and redraw that destiny. OR Cancel Watto's Chance Cube. OR If your character of ability > 2 is in battle, use 1 Force to cancel and redraw a just drawn destiny. This card is also non-unique, so you can play it many times during a battle phase to retrieve many cards. This strategy is still very new and the current build of the deck has many other powerful Interrupts like Are You Brain Dead?!, It Could Be Worse, and Blaster Deflection that can also be abused if the Dice is grabbed. You now have a few options in how you build this deck. It is slowly becoming a solid and unexpected choice for LS. The deck also has two new Jedi that they didn't have before; Master Qui-Gon (V12) and Ki-Ai Mundi (V12). Both of them can provide benefits to the deck that make it that much better. Another way to re-draw battle destiny is with the new Changing the Odds (V12). It says both players re-draw, which would still give you the retrieval.\\par \\par Why I SHOULD Play It: The most powerful versions of this deck currently play Krayt Dragon Howl (V8) to start the game with ANY version of Obi you want with his matching lightsaber already at the Junkyard before you even start the game. Combined with the new Mace (V9), Master Qui-Gon (V12), and Yoda, JCM (V12), this objective has been given a new direction. Another idea with this deck is to use that old droid from premiere, CZ-3, who lets you 'react' by deploying CARDS, not just characters but ANY card you want at normal use of force. Then you can combine him with Don't Forget the Droids (V8) to keep the DS from getting ANY weapon or destiny draws in that battle. Since you have the ability to get some strong retrieval with this deck, it has now become a very powerful option for LS. If they decide to change the ruling about the Redraw, then this deck will not be quite as powerful. You might want to get as many games in with the deck as possible before it changes.\\par \\par Why NOT to Play It: The biggest problem this deck has is space. Much like WYS and WHAP, you are restricted to which ships you are able to play. Since the majority of the deck is for keeping and holding the Junkyard. The most common version of this deck choose to leave out space all together. So you have to play very smart in order to have a chance against SYCFA Fear or CCT space. The key to winning games against space-based decks is to try to do as much early damage and retrieval as possible. Against SYCFA, just go after Sidious at the Docking Bay but don't kill him. He is your best source for retrieval and the only character they will give you on the ground. The problem this deck has always had and continues to have is that is can lose to very specific deck types. Scum can beat down the Jedi that are trying to hold the Junkyard. Combat prevents the drain and just knocks the Jedi off the table. Huntdown can Duel off your Jedi and cause direct damage all game. Walkers cause a lot of direct damage and plays on a totally different planet and never has to interact with Tatooine to win. This objective protects against Your Destiny with Luke not being able to be in the deck, but they still forgot about Agents of the Black Sun, which it doesn't protect from, so you take 2 in direct damage all game since Luke will never be hitting the table. The weaknesses this deck has are not as bad as they used to be with the new Dice tech and additional Jedi in V12. You really need to know how to play this deck in order to win with it, so new players should look elsewhere.",
