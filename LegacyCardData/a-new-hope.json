He may provide nav computer capability on a starship as a passenger, but Brainiac is not an astromech and thus cannot occupy astromech capacity.\\par Imaginary numbers (which have a negative number within the square root) result in a minimum power of 1. Also, players must use the positive root (thus, the square root of 4 is 2, not -2).\\par Brainiac's destiny and power should not be rounded. If you're comparing this number to a certain value, examine it to see if it meets the requirements. For example, if Alter targets Luke Skywalker and Brainiac is drawn, Alter succeeds (because p is less than 4), and if All Wings Report In targets your three YWings, it also succeeds (p is greater than 3). If Brainiac is drawn for battle destiny and a player must satisfy p attrition, that player must forfeit at least p points of forfeit value (usually meaning 4 must be forfeited). However, you must round whenever you are required to do something which is impossible in partial amounts (e.g., you cannot retrieve, activate, or lose an irrational amount of Force, you cannot cause an irrational number of characters to be lost, etc.). For example, Vader initiates a duel against Luke using Vader's Obsession (\"Each adds two destiny to power. Winner retrieves lost Force equal to the difference. Loser loses same amount of Force, plus the character.\"), and one of Luke's destinies is Brainiac. Vader's total is 14 and Luke's is 14.14159..., which means that Luke wins and retrieves Force equal to the difference (0.14159...). Because that's impossible, Light retrieves 0. Dark loses the same amount, also rounding to 0, and Vader, because even though no Force was lost or retrieved, Luke's total was still higher.",

The DS got this strategy rather than a brand new Objective to equal out the two sides since the LS currently has one extra Objective to play with. The PC created a few specific virtual cards that combine to form a totally new strategy. The idea is to set up specific Imperial characters to the Death Star: Conference Room to build up 'Influence'. The whole deck works around There Is No Try & Oppressive Reinforcement (V12). This card deploys on the Conference Room and creates the entire strategy around the Imperial Council. It says you may NOT deploy ANY Episode I icon cards and no aliens (except Bounty Hunters & Mara Jade). This means no P-59, no Sidious, and of course no Maul. Your Starting Effect is in play to start the game before this card, so you can still use them but that's it. From this setup, TINT Combo (V12) makes the Emperor and all Moffs, Generals, and Admirals into Imperial Council Members who each have Influence +1. For each member present at the Council, you gain an additional DS Force Icon, (this is not a bonus in activation, but an additional icon sort of like a Jedi Master). During each Control phase, you can use 2 Force to take into hand any Imperial Council Member, Laser Gate, or Political Effect (PE). It goes on to say your cards may be played from your PEs and any PE that is canceled goes to Used pile. Since TINT Combo was used to do all of this, you will have to play SAC or multiple Controls to protect your red stuff. Virtual Imperials were released in V11 and V12 for this specific strategy. The first character was Sim Aloo (V11), who adds a battle destiny at the Council. Officer Evax (V12), Janus (V12), and Colonel Wullf Yularen (V12) followed Sim in the next set. The four of them each have printed Influence of 1 or 2, then get the additional +1 from TINT Combo. Once you set up the Imperial at the Council, your total number of Influence is used to apply different aspects to the game. Each of the new Virtual Imperial Council Members can do a specific thing based around the total number of Influence you have. Much like regular Senate, this strategy places cards on the PEs. Currently there are two PEs that were made for Imperial Council; Blown Clear (V12) and Crush the Rebellion (V12). Both do the exact same thing except that one works in space and the other on the ground. Basically you deploy an Imperial Council Member with the required text onto one of the PEs. While this Imperial is on the PE, you may target one character or starship in battle to be power and forfeit -X where X equals the total number of Influence you have at the Council. This aspect alone provides you an automatic form of beatdown against lone characters or starships. When you add the new abilities of each Imperial Council Member, this deck could become a new powerhouse for DS.\\par \\par How It Can Win: The idea for this deck is completely brand new. So much so that no one has mentioned playing with it or what the best build would be for a deck. In creating the cards for the Imperial Council, the PC designed a new Starting Interrupt to set up all the cards needed. Imperial Code Cylinder (V12) lets you start the game with Ord Mantell and the Death Star: War Room on table. You may then start TINT and two more Effects (can't be You Cannot Hide Forever or Endor Shield). While this does get both the Conference Room and TINT Effect in play to start the game, it doesn't give you much for activation and prevents you from playing Endor Shield (V11) (which auto pulls two Imperial Council Members). Even though the PC took the time to create a Starting Interrupt for setting up this new strategy, they didn't prevent the DS player from using the SYCFA Objective. Since SYCFA can pull ANY card with Death Star in title, you can get the Conference Room in play on your first turn the same way. Plus you don't take ANY battle damage on the Death Star. Also, because you are playing the Objective you are not prevented from starting Endor Shield (V11). Since the TINI Combo deploys on a location, you can start Crossfire (V9) to take it into hand to start the game. Considering the fact that you would be activating 5 through SYCFA over just 3 from the Starting Interrupt, it makes way more sense to set up the Imperial Council around SYCFA. The only reason you would want to use the Starting Interrupt is because you don't have the docking bay in play for the LS to deploy to and move over. Once you deployed Tarkin (V3), the LS would be prevented from deploying any spies or Jar Jar to all Death Star sites. If you also have Imperial Arrest Order in play, there would be no possible way for the LS to ever deploy or move to the Conference Room unless they played their own Death Star docking bay. While it might turn out later to work better with the Starting Interrupt, I see no reason to not use SYCFA since you never take battle damage. You can also set up a Laser Gate (V12) in between the Conference Room and another interior Death Star site to cause the opponent to lose 1 Force to move a character through the Gate. Once you decide how you want to set up this deck, from there you have to decide how the deck will play out. Because you can still play with Bounty Hunters, there are many different possibilities. You cannot play with Maul, so your only powerful ground character is going to be Vader or EPP Mara. It would make sense to play the stronger ground based Bounty Hunters to go after the LS Jedi. Snoova would be a good choice since he is just as powerful as Vader and has the ability to easily capture any character. If you decide to play SYCFA, you would put the Death Star: Detention Block in between the docking bay and Conference Room as a place to put the characters you capture.\\par \\par What Changed Since 1st Edition: Of course this didn't exist at the time of the first Edition of this document, so I am using this section to provide more possible ideas for Imperial Council. There are many possibilities for your space package. You could even play a combination of both Imperial and Bounty Hunter matching ships. Much like other DS strategies, the matching ships can be a very solid way to both beatdown and hold presence in space. Since you have Blown Clear (V12) to reduce the power and forfeit of a starship, you can play Lateral Damage to hurt two different LS ships in battle. The majority of the time, the LS will only have 2 to 3 ships at one system, so you would have the advantage if you decided to build a space based strategy. It could be as simple as just using Victory Class Destroyers with weapons, so you can play They've Shut Down the Main Reactor to prevent ships from moving and drawing battle destiny. It would even be possible to build a SYCFA Fear deck around the Imperial Council. Since this is a completely new idea, there is really no telling what could be built from it. As long as the main deck builders are still playing their favorite decks, no one will be playing this strategy. Player have to decide to do some playtesting around the different aspects of the deck to discover its uses. By the time there is a 3rd Edition of this Encyclopedia, there will be much more to write about the Imperial Council.\\par \\par Why I SHOULD Play It: This is a great deck for playing something REALLY new. Not just an idea based around older ideas but a completely original strategy for DS. Almost every aspect of Imperial Council is new and the abilities of the PEs make it worth a look. For now, I don't have a great deck idea for how this strategy should be played. It will take players throwing some ideas together to see where it goes. Anyone who decides to play this deck in a tournament will be putting the LS opponent in a new situation. No one is prepared for what you might be playing with this deck. So you have a huge chance of the opponent making mistakes; deploying cards without knowing what to expect or losing cards too early that may have made a difference. The key will be to playtest your idea against the popular LS decks. If it does well, then you might have a new powerful DS deck that no one has any experience with. When the original virtual WYS (V8) was brand new, no one knew how to play against it and lost because they made mistakes by trying to take over Corellia. This deck could turn out to be just as strong as soon as someone decides to play around with it. Will you be the next player to design a broken deck for SWCCG?? This deck is probably your best bet. Don't be afraid to give it a try while the strategy is still brand new.\\par \\par Why NOT to Play It: The same reason to stay away from the other new ideas posted in this article. Imperial Council is completely and totally unproven. There is no standard build from which to alter and no one has been playing it at major tournaments. While this is still un-tested, it may not be the best choice if you are trying to qualify for Worlds or play in a big tournament. Unless you feel like you have found something strong, it would be wise to go with something you might be more familiar with. As time passes, I see this strategy becoming very very popular. There might even be a broken build for the deck already out there that no one has thought of. Do you feel lucky??",

Battles at holosites are similar to battles at other sites (including destiny draws and attrition if you have 4 or more ability present). So Visage Of The Emperor (destiny = power = ability = 7) and Image Of The Dark Lord (destiny = power = ability = 6) are extremely powerful holograms to be reckoned with at the Imperial Holotable - the Light Side doesn't have any dejariks or holograms that can compete with these cards on a one-to-one basis!\\par \\par I like to start with the Imperial Holotable, and pack two Visage Of The Emperor, two Image Of The Dark Lord, and two Monnok cards in my deck.

Two things in Cloud City made this card especially great: interior draining and Trooper Assault.\\par \\par Since Stunning Leader only works at interior sites, most people found little use for it before Cloud City. After all, the best draining sites for the Dark Side were almost exclusively exterior! Virtually every Dark Side site with a Force drain for two or more was an exterior site like the Tatooine: Lars' Moisture Farm, Tatooine: Jundland Wastes, or Hoth: Defensive Perimeter.\\par With the release of Cloud City, the Dark Side now has a set of interior sites with decent draining opportunities. Unlike the Death Star or Executor sites, these have Light Side icons allowing a modest drain. Adding Dark Deal to a Cloud City deck could be devastating to an ill-prepared Light Side deck. With lightsabers and Dark Deal, Cloud City is an okay place to Force drain for the Dark Side. Oh, and don't forget about Bounty Hunting opportunities.\\par \\par Along with Cloud City's interior sites came a nice Used Interrupt called Trooper Assault. This card simulates the endless hordes of troopers the Imperial Army seems to muster by making all Dark Side troopers in a battle power +2 and immune to all attrition. This one interrupt almost single-handedly made troopers viable again.\\par \\par So where does Stunning Leader fit into the equation? Well, consider a Cloud City Force drain deck with troopers as its primary site defenses. Every site (don't use the Docking Bay) is interior, meaning Stunning Leader can be played at a site battle anywhere. All troopers are ability 2 or lower, so they won't be excluded from the battle when Stunning Leader is played - this interrupt isolates your troopers against the Light Side's non-mains.",
