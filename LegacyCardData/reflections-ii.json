This is currently the only DS deck that starts a character at the beginning of the game. When it first came out, it was made into one of the strongest decks that could be played. Back then, it played with an unheard of 6x Emperor Palpatines so you would get one in your opening hand and always have him on the table all game. The extra destiny 6 cards in your reserve didn't hurt much either. As time passed, it seemed to die off because it was limited on who it could play with and usually missed not being able to play with Vader or Maul. The PC decided that this deck needed some help, so they created a good 8 cards to help this objective. The two strongest being Prince Xizor (V7), which made a larger number of characters into Black Sun agents as well as provide forfeit +1 to all them. He also pulls Unexpected Interruption, so you now have the ability to find ANY Interrupt you want from your deck. The other powerful V card is Information Exchange (V7), which allows Scum and Villainy to deploy on the Imperial City and lets you deploy ANY card with \"Black Sun� or \"Xizor� in their lore. This means you can pull The Emperor (V6) just like BHBM. Information Exchange (V7) has totally changed how powerful this deck is because it can pull almost every powerful character. Because it allows Scum to work in this deck, all your aliens deploy cheaper and give you 2 Force retrieval when you initiate battle. The possibilities for the deck have changed but the idea behind it has not. Get Xizor to a battleground, keep him alive, battle the LS and keep Luke off the table. The original version had problems in space since your only option for Coruscant was the non-battleground version from Special Editions. Since the Coruscant set released a battleground version of the system., it is much easier to set up both ground and space for free draining. You also have the option of sending Xizor to space from the docking bay since the objective just say he has to be on table. The direct damage also works in space.\\par \\par How It Can Win: This deck has a lot of things going for it now. Besides Information Exchange (V7) letting you play Scum, the DS has many other V cards that have made this deck very solid. Like all DS alien decks, you have Bounty Hunters as your attacking force allowing you to capture or cause beatdown. The difference with Black Sun is you can play with cards that greatly increase your characters forfeit. Desilijic Tattoo (V5) says all your Bounty Hunters and Independent starships are forfeit +2 and defense value +1. Ket Maliss (V3) says your Agents are also forfeit +2 and defense value +1 while Emperor Palpatine is not on table. So if you want to play the forfeit bonus version of the deck, you can't play the old fashion Emperor but must instead use only The Emperor (V6). Xizor (V7) adds another +1 to Black Sun Agents forfeit, so with those three cards EACH Bounty Hunter is forfeit +5!! Greedo (V3) is forfeit 9, Bossk (V5) is 10, Dengar (V5) is 11, Fett is 12, etc. Den of Thieves (V8) protects the forfeit of your aliens with ability < 3, while Zuckess (V7) says ALL Black Sun agents may not have their forfeit reduced at same and related sites. This deck can be very hard to beat if the LS deck is forced to battle in order to win. Since you are constantly retrieving 2 Force when you initiate battle, you keep getting the characters back into your deck that are forfeited. Ket Maliss (V3) pulls Greedo (V3) over and over to play for 1, forfeit for 9, retrieve, and repeat all over again. First Strike gives you another retrieved Force when you initiate as well as makes the LS lose a Force. Besides the bonus to forfeit, Black Sun can be a better option for DS aliens because of the objective. The seven side of this objective provides deck manipulation. It lets you peek at cards in either Reserve deck during your battle phase so you will either know what your destiny draw is going to be or what your opponent's draw is going to be. You can also look at the cards in your Force pile simply by putting any card back in your Used pile. The objective doesn't require you to reshuffle, so you know what cards you are using and which ones you will get to draw. If that wasn't enough, you also cause added attrition in battle with your Black Sun agents and direct damage while the Emperor or Xizor are at a battleground.\\par \\par What Changed Since 1st Edition: The Re Edit did a lot to fix the problems with this deck. Before, Jabba's Influence (V6) said you had to play Emperor Palpatine for S&V to work, while Ket Maliss (V3) said you had to play The Emperor (V6) if you wanted the forfeit bonus. Since both cards are useful in Black Sun, the Re Edit fixed this problem by saying S&V worked with any Emperor while Xizor is on table. Black Sun is now being played with just The Emperor (V6), which loses the immunity to attrition and the destiny of 6. This does add the built in shock and the ability to be pulled from Reserve with Information Exchange (V7). The original Guri (V7) was stronger by adding a destiny with Xizor. The Re Edit removed her additional destiny and ability to protect her forfeit but she still adds +1 to Force drains at Coruscant sites and can be forfeited to satisfy battle damage while in battle with Xizor. The non-V Guri is still a powerful option for this deck since she prevents the LS from drawing more than one battle destiny as well as prevents the LS from targeting Xizor with weapons. Most versions will play with one of each to be used as needed. The space package in this deck got better with Stinger (V12). Now you can play Stinger (V12) with Combat Response since the V version removed the permanent pilot. The cool thing about this card is it gives you a built in Threepio, With Parts Showing text only you don't have to put a card down. Once per turn, you can just take the top card of your Reserve deck into hand. Since the objective lets you look at the card before you battle, you will know if you want that card to begin with. It also says you take from Force pile if Chewie or Leia on table, so you can use this function after searching your Force pile with the objective. Since Guri was usually used for protection of Xizor, you can use IE (V7) to find both Stinger (V12) and Guri, then load up Xizor, and fly up to the system for protection. Aurra Sing (V12) is also a great addition to this deck since she can relocate to sites where opponent has a Jedi. This makes it harder for Jedi Luke to hide. Dark Jedi Lightsaber (V12) can be played on Aurra, so the deck finally has a lightsaber for killing off hard to hit characters like Mace and Qui-Gon. What really hurt this deck was the change of Ability, Ability, Ability (V6) in the Re Edit. The original said you could take a character into hand when you initiated battle and now you just retrieve a character. This is still strong and is still worth including in the deck, but not as powerful as having the character already in hand to battle next turn.\\par \\par Why I SHOULD Play It: Black Sun is truly a powerful option for DS. The listed strategy can be put together to make a very versatile powerhouse. Unlike the other DS alien decks, this one has the BEST space package since the forfeit of all your Bounty Hunter pilots is so high. Not to mention you can just pile up other aliens to absorb attrition and battle damage. This makes it VERY hard to knock the DS out of space. The objective also provides manipulation, so you have the added ability to know what is going on with both decks before you make a decision. Black Sun has very good retrieval all game as long as S&V is going strong. Rather than have large amounts of retrieval at once like Court, BS retrieves from battling over and over and over until the LS is out of characters. Black Sun works very similar to LS Agents since it constantly retrieves the characters to be played again and again. This makes it a good choice for DS if you want a deck that can be hard to out damage. Black Sun gets the most Timed Wins of any DS deck. Any LS strategy that deploys to the ground and relies on its ground forces to win will have trouble against this deck. It does well against Combat, Hyperdeal (since the objective can't play with Luke, but doesn't prevent them losing the direct damage), Agents, QMC, TIGIH, and WYS.\\par \\par Why NOT to Play It: The biggest weakness this deck has is it relies on Xizor staying alive to win. If he can be killed, the objective cannot be flipped to its seven side, so much of your time is spent trying to protect him. The deck also has to keep Luke off a battleground as well, so you have a problem if you come up against Commander Luke (V4) in Rogue 1 because all he has to be is 'at' the site not present. The other problem with this deck is it doesn't always do a lot of damage by itself. The majority of builds only play the docking bays as battlegrounds. If the LS gets Jedi Test 1 or Menace Fades going to cancel the drain bonuses and puts Projections on your sites, you will only be doing damage from the objective. Throw Luke into the mix and the objective is flipped meaning you do NO damage. Bane (V7) is very important for keeping at least one drain free from losing the bonuses. Even though the space package is better with the added forfeit, this deck can still be beat with starship weapons. Some versions of Hidden Base put Commander Luke (V4) at a desert with a Sandwhirl. Since it can also play Menace Fades and cancel two drains, this can be a hard match-up. Black Sun will always be strong when the LS has decks that set up on the ground. It can sometimes have problems against Speeders or HB.",

Since that would require a revision to thousands of cards, that's simply not practical. Every effort has been made to identify and discern what are and are not characteristics. Some may be missing from the list, while others are deliberately absent. Discerning which is which requires a bit of research and judgment.\\par \\par After investigating, we're adding skiff and sandcrawler to the list of characteristics which apply to vehicles.\\par \\par This brings us to the matter of (LS) Intruder Missile. This weapon and its possible interaction with Outrider has been a matter the PC has been considering for some time. By the rules, the one could not deploy on the other, but we were not ignorant of the possibility that this was an error of omission. Having looked through the evidence, we're now confident that Intruder Missile was not intended to work with Outrider.\\par \\par We do not make these decisions lightly, and attempt to be thorough in our research of the original intent of the card interactions. We searched the records of play testing that we have from the development of Shadows of the Empire (the set that was incorporated into Reflections 2). In an original version of the Outrider, it was created to work with Intruder Missile, both via game text and the inclusion of the \"YT-2400\" in the subtype box. However, the game text was stricken over the course of play testing, and the \"YT-2400\" text moved out of the subtype box into the lore. This move was significant - the characteristic rules were well in place at this time, and Decipher had ensured that references to starships were almost entirely to icons or the contents of the subtype box. The only exceptions to this were defined characteristics (all ships are enclosed and all TIE/sa and B-wings are bombers) or squadron designations (which could be found in title, lore, or game text). Decipher, in fact, released only one card which was referenced by its lore instead of subtype: Blockade Flagship, because \"Droid Control Ship\" would not fit in that box - and Decipher then made a note to declare Droid Control Ship a characteristic.\\par \\par Neither of these cases applied to Outrider - our tests using the original templates showed that \"YT-2400\" would fit with room to spare, and we know that Decipher made no such announcement. In addition, the text on Intruder Missile states that it also may deploy on the Falcon. It was not until two years after Intruder Missile came out that a Falcon was created that didn't state \"YT-1300\" in lore (both the original and Lando in Millennium Falcon did). If Decipher intended to reference it in lore, this specific mention wouldn't have been necessary.\\par \\par Given the state of the characteristic rules at the time by Decipher, the striking of the game text, and the deliberate choice to remove a referenced card aspect from the subtype box, we feel this is sufficient evidence to support the existing ruling: Intruder Missile may not deploy on Outrider.\\par \\par Because this matter has confused many players over the years, we are going to issue the following errata to Intruder Missile (LS) in the hopes of minimizing further confusion:\\par \\par LS Intruder Missile:\\par Deploy on your B-wing, Z-95, YT-1300 Transport, or Falcon. May target a capital starship for free. Draw destiny. Add 3 if that capital starship was targeted by another weapon this turn. Target hit if total destiny > defense value.

    "Information": "Article on DeckTech, August 19th, 2007 '2nd Annual SWCCG Encyclopedia of Decks' by Brandon \"Jabba_the_Ruck\" Ruck\\par http://www.decktech.net/starwarsccg/articles/articles.php?id=6526&view=2\\par \\par Popular Cards to Look For: Kessel, Version of Luke, lot of Smugglers, Krayt Dragon Howl (V8), Obi-Wan Kenobi, Jedi Knight (V11), Palace Raiders, Patrol Crafts, Racing Skiffs, I'll Take the Leader, good number of battling and evasion Interrupts\\par \\par Idea Behind Objectives: The first LS objective to restrict the use of any type of characters. Until this objective, all the objectives could be built with anyone. This one meant that Obi and Leia had to be left out of the mix. It was a very solid deck over the years becoming popular very quickly after its release. It is one of the hardest objective for the DS to flip back among the objectives that can be flipped back. The objective has so many things that it does to help the LS and just completely hurt the DS. If you play this deck, you have to get used to playing with only Smugglers and Luke, as well as a very limited amount of starships to choose from. That is where the real test begins because with this deck, you can either be very powerful on the ground or in space, but it is very hard to control both areas. In the early days, the deck was built around space playing with Captain Han and sometimes putting Luke in space. Then the idea came about to play with non-unique Palace Raiders which could react (deploy or move) on transport vehicles and with the objective got 2 or even 3 destinies when they got matched up with any other smuggler including another Palace Raider.\\par \\par How It Can Win: It wins by utilizing all of the bonuses the 7 side provides. The first part says all DS non-battlegrounds generate only 1 Force a turn. Another powerful part is the ability to draw an extra destiny when you have multiple smugglers together. Two smugglers get 2 destinies and +2 to their forfeit, which makes it hard to beatdown when they are protected by either vehicles or in space. The objective causes the DS game text of Kessel to be canceled, which makes it very easy to play Kessel Run over and over again. It can use cards like Nightfall to tech against specific decks like Walkers by allowing your Spies to deploy for free to that planet, so that means Boushh and Lando with Vibro Axe go down for free. Then you add Luke, Han with Gun or Chewie, Engraged to make for a very big beatdown. A very strong part of the objective is completely preventing the DS from getting to play Sense or Alter. Literally, one of the main reasons the deck continues to be a strong deck type. But the strongest part of the deck is being able to play Interrupts from your Lost pile by placing them out of play. Many times the DS player will not be paying attention to what random cards were lost from drains three turns earlier, so you can easily set up surprise beatdowns with Clash of Sabers and Run Luke Run.\\par \\par What Changed Since 1st Edition: The introduction of Obi, JK (V11) and Krayt Dragon Howl (V8) is used to start Obi already in the Cantina. So you start the game with a drain of 3. Since most DS decks can't set up to fight Obi on their first turn, the LS gets an auto drain of 3. The deck is built with tons of different battle and evasion Interrupts that can each be played twice per game once flipped; Dodge, SATM Combo, Blaster Deflection, It's a Trap, Rebel Barrier, Clash of Sabers, and Blast the Door Kid! all protect Obi. Since you only get 3 cards in your opening hand, the deck has to play with enough protective cards to draw 1 early. This is because in WYS, the only copy of Obi that you play is the one you start. If he dies, most of what the deck was built to do is wasted. Besides the new Obi deck, another new strategy for this deck was discovered. The WYS Panic deck is currently being played in some parts of the world. This deck relies completely on Panic to win the game. Panic is a Used Interrupt from Premiere that says if opponent initiated battle where their power is double your power, draw 3 cards, deploy ANYWHERE FOR FREE any characters, starships, vehicles, or weapons, all others are lost. This card is not unique, so you can play it more than once from one battle. The version of this deck uses mainly Ralltiir Freighter Captains since they are Smugglers and then lots of random stuff. Since everything deploys for free, you can play Home One, random characters, etc. The main build posted plays 7x Panic, 8x Captains, and 7x Medium Bulk Freighters. The only red cards in the deck are reactive Effects and some evasion Interrupts. The majority of the deck is stuff that can be played with Panic. The reason this deck works is because even if Panic is grabbed, the ones that go to lost pile can still be placed out of play and played again just as long as you keep paying for them. Your starting Effects are totally based on what the opponent is playing. You have five to choose from in Civil Disorder (V6), Dismantle on Sight (V11), K'lor Slug (V2), The Professor (V9), and Wokling (V4). The strategy of the deck can be found on Decktech. This is not a deck that plays normally, so if you decide to play it, make sure to get in a few practice games before you go to a major tournament.\\par \\par Why I SHOULD Play It: For as long as WYS has existed, it has always been a very difficult deck for the DS to beat. From my experience, WYS is the second most powerful 7 side in the game behind Rescue the Princess. Every part hurts the DS or make the LS a lot stronger. When you combine the fact that you get to play your Interrupts each twice per game, with the objective preventing DS from playing Sense to cancel them, this deck is very hard to beat. Plus, the deck is very easy to play. It sets up Celebration on Tatooine, with drains at the sites and Kessel then waits for the DS to stop them. If you can stay flipped, your opponent will not have an easy game. Decks like Huntdown and Walkers that play with a lot of non-battlegrounds really take a hit against this deck with the limit of 1 Force generation at most of their sites. The best version of this deck is the non-unique Palace Raider version, so you need to have a good collection of Jabba's Palace Sealed Deck. The Smugglers get really awesome bonuses with this deck, so you really have a solid format for a LS deck. The deck can also set up I'll Take the Leader, which adds +1 to Force drains at docking bays, and on Tatooine you can play with 3 different ones. The AO allows you to land a starfighter that has been forfeited from a battle at the system. Meaning you can land Han, Chewie, and Falcon, then take back off during your move phase since the action of landing with the AO didn't use your landspeed.\\par \\par Why NOT to Play It: WYS has always been weak to decks with a lot of direct damage. Since you can't play any Jedi or Leia, Huntdown only has to worry about Luke in order to stay flipped and cause Visage damage all game. If Luke is in space, they prevent him from draining, if he comes to ground, then they either duel him or throw all forces to kill him. Plus now they also have Emperor's Power (V11) to add 1 in direct force loss. Huntdown can also take over the Cantina and drain for 2 to 3 all game. The only way WYS can beat Huntdown is if they can keep Vader off the table or cancel Visage. The other problem is the Palace Raiders rely on reacting in order to keep from getting beatdown. If you can't play Run Luke Run or they cancel your React, the the Raider can get beatdown. Of course this deck should play Houjix for those times. Most of the time, this deck can be weak in one of the two areas of play. It is hard with the restrictions to have a powerful force in both space and on the ground. The deck is also very very open to DS Undercover spies because they don't get to play with Corran Horn. Fozac (V8) says while Undercover, all Force drains at related locations are -1. Since there is no way to get around him, if Luke is in space there is little chance of the spy getting hit with SATM Combo. So Fozac (V8) can literally shut down almost all drain damage in this deck. Although this objective is still strong, it's not always the best choice for a LS deck in metas with a lot of Huntdown.",
