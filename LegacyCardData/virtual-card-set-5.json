The reason it makes my list is that it is another case of retrieval without retrieving, just like Flash (V). Secure Route opened up Theed Palace to the Light Side player by removing onerous deployment restrictions brought upon themselves by the objective. This alone would help WHAP, but it also let you get a nice kickback when you deploy to Theed Palace. Unlike Flash (V), SR (V) lets you take the \"retrieved\" card into hand, which is incredibly powerful and lets the Light player be extremely reactive. This power has been around for a while (see No Escape), but being able to do this every turn (and with such a variety of card choices) was a new wrinkle for the LS, especially since other methods of getting back those characters exist already. Again, this truly only fits into few decks other than WHAP, which knocks it down the list, but its power in those decks is incredible.\\par \\par ARMAEDES' TAKE:\\par This is a card I didn't even consider for my own list due to it's limited usability. It's a very strong damage controller, no doubt, but it's really only useful in WHAP decks or a non-WHAP deck that uses Republic characters and interior Naboo sites; I can't fathom such a deck being good, but I suppose it's possible.",
