    "Information": "Article at DeckTech, November 1st, 2005\\par Top 5 Damage-Controlling V-Cards (Dark Side) by Armaedes and Shewski\\par \\par These cards (especially the LS version) were overshadowed in V9 by Entrenchment, but they are useful in their own right. These cards are powerful solutions to single site, mega drain decks that have plagued SWCCG throughout its lifetime. The biggest drawback is not getting cards lost from hand to the drain back into hand, so you lose hand advantage. If you lose from Reserve, you will get it right back into circulation, albeit at the bottom of your Reserve Deck. An enterprising player can use this expected retrieval to do some tracking. Some LS decks that are still popular, including AITC, offer many enhanced drains and being able to effectively ignore one of them is a great tool for the DS player.\\par \\par ARMAEDES' TAKE:\\par This card almost made my list, actually. This is really good for those new Endor decks that can drain with three or four lightsabers at one location, turning a drain of 4-6 into a far more manageable drain of one or two. Also good for a Jedi Council Chambers drain deck that wants to hurt you for a big drain at a non-battleground using Jedi Lightsaber (V)s. A Bright Center To The Universe (V) makes those deck look silly. The only reason this didn't make my list is because of the qualifications of the card - you have to control more battlegrounds than the opponent. In certain situations, like the \"drain at one location for a million\" type of decks, this is easy to pull off, but against a deck that spreads and drains (i.e. QMC with Pucumir) this card loses a lot - if not all - of its potency.",

This can often mean the difference between victory and loss. Boba Fett changes all of that. He is the first character to key off of the \"just\" action of a battle being initiated. Some Interrupts in the past have done that, but never characters. This Boba is cool since he is an EPP w/o having a permanent weapon icon. Like Empy (V), this makes him eligible for a lot of cards we have mentioned before. The ability to easily remove a character from battle before your opponent has the ability to do anything is very potent. He essentially trumps all types of other weapons and text. Capturing is quite strong since it is not an \"immediately lost\" action that can be countered by cards like K'lor Slug and the like. From now on, the choice of Bobas will be between this version and BFBH.\\par \\par ARMAEDES' TAKE:\\par I despise this Boba Fett persona. Not because he's bad, but because he's so friggin' good. I have played games against this guy where I had a big stack of mains on Fett with Binders. One of my favorite combinations is to add his Fett's Blaster Rifle (V) to him and then play Hidden Weapons and Defensive Fire (V). With the right destiny draws, you can very easily clear out 4 characters per battle (destiny +2 with his text, destiny +4 with Defensive Fire (V), destiny +2 with his rifle, then Hidden Weapons). Especially if you've got You Cannot Hide Forever out and Lando Calrissian (V) hiding somewhere, this Fett can definitely hold a site by himself.

It's very easy to play since its initiation conditions are similar to another standby, Battle Order/Plan. These shields work to discourage cowardly play, like running away from battles on your turn (Watch out for Honor reducing this!) or not fighting you when they deploy to the table. Many decks have been built so that they can take full advantage of this gametext. [...]\\par \\par ARMAEDES' TAKE:\\par Excellent choice, this was actually #6 on my list. It barely missed the cut because the second portion of the text requires that you control a site and a system to make it work, and hardcore battling decks rarely do this. The part of the card that makes the opponent lose Force can be good, but frankly if your opponent has a choice between taking a beating and losing a measley two cards (which, as you point out, is reduced by Honor Of The Jedi), they're going to lose the 2 no questions asked. In other words, those this is a card that should be played in every battling deck, it doesn't actually help your big battles happen because the opponent is still able to use their \"escape\" cards, they just have to lose a couple of Force to do so - which oftentimes is a fair trade.",

It's really obnoxious when you keep losing your ability off the top of your deck and are unable to keep up with your opponent due to a weak-battling hand. Imperial Reinforcements (V) can correct this problem and breathe some life back into your deck by giving you some more ability to fight with. Other than the cards needing to be Imperial, there are no other stipulations, which means you can retrieve EPP Vader into hand if the opportunity arises. The ability to pull a powerful Imperial like EPP Vader out of the Lost Pile at any time is an incredible ability to have.\\par \\par SHEWSKI'S TAKE:\\par \\par Eh, yeah, it's pretty good but much like my comments on Merc Sunlet, I HATE having to rely on losing the game (at least being behind in terms of board control) to use a card.

The Dark Side is rife with popular ways to get rid of your heroes such as Dr. Evazan, Dark Strike, and Choke Vader. K'lor Slug (and Molator for the DS) helps you avoid painful beatdowns due to sudden losses of power and destiny draws. While this is more like IMI in that it helps your battles hold their effectiveness, the second part of the text goes very well with immunity mains. Your mains can get out at their normal cost, which greatly speeds up the time it takes to get them into play by a turn or more.\\par \\par ARMAEDES' TAKE:\\par Again, I find this less of an offensive aid than a defensive aid, and more of a battle-hindering card than anything else. The dark side's character removal is a big way dark wins battles, so in my opinion taking this away makes effective battling more challenging. I really like this card - I think it is a necessary component of the game - but I'm not sure I would classify it as a battling aid.",

She is a very cheap destiny draw that allows for an early disruption of the Dark Side's setup. Though envisioned as an anti-Senate card, she has many other strong uses. Most used is probably her leader canceling game text, which can set up some beats of her own. She can take the teeth out of Jabba, Xizor, P-59, Fel, Igar, Ephant Mon, Veers, Thrawn, and Tarkin. This text always works as well. Typically, such a powerful card wouldn't be so cheap, but she has been an early thorn in my opponent's side for some time now. Usually my choice for a utility Leia, but Princess Leia (V) deserves consideration as well.\\par \\par ARMAEDES' TAKE:\\par YES! Leia (V) is a fantastic battling card. Not only does she have strong gametext for battling herself, but she also takes a bite out of senate, which is a deck that makes effective battling by the light side more challenging. I would even put this Leia above EPP Leia for battling effectiveness. Great pick by Shewski!",

The Dark Side is rife with popular ways to get rid of your heroes such as Dr. Evazan, Dark Strike, and Choke Vader. K'lor Slug (and Molator for the DS) helps you avoid painful beatdowns due to sudden losses of power and destiny draws. While this is more like IMI in that it helps your battles hold their effectiveness, the second part of the text goes very well with immunity mains. Your mains can get out at their normal cost, which greatly speeds up the time it takes to get them into play by a turn or more.\\par \\par ARMAEDES' TAKE:\\par Again, I find this less of an offensive aid than a defensive aid, and more of a battle-hindering card than anything else. The dark side's character removal is a big way dark wins battles, so in my opinion taking this away makes effective battling more challenging. I really like this card - I think it is a necessary component of the game - but I'm not sure I would classify it as a battling aid.",

These cards are powerful solutions to single site, mega drain decks that have plagued SWCCG throughout its lifetime. The biggest drawback is not getting cards lost from hand to the drain back into hand, so you lose hand advantage. If you lose from Reserve, you will get it right back into circulation, albeit at the bottom of your Reserve Deck. An enterprising player can use this expected retrieval to do some tracking. Some LS decks that are still popular, including AITC, offer many enhanced drains and being able to effectively ignore one of them is a great tool for the DS player.\\par \\par ARMAEDES' TAKE:\\par This card almost made my list, actually. This is really good for those new Endor decks that can drain with three or four lightsabers at one location, turning a drain of 4-6 into a far more manageable drain of one or two. Also good for a Jedi Council Chambers drain deck that wants to hurt you for a big drain at a non-battleground using Jedi Lightsaber (V)s. A Bright Center To The Universe (V) makes those deck look silly. The only reason this didn't make my list is because of the qualifications of the card - you have to control more battlegrounds than the opponent. In certain situations, like the \"drain at one location for a million\" type of decks, this is easy to pull off, but against a deck that spreads and drains (i.e. QMC with Pucumir) this card loses a lot - if not all - of its potency.",
