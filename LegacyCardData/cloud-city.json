    "Information": "Protector, like Old Pirates, presents a new twist on the traditional \"teamwork\" cards, such as Don't Get Cocky and Gift Of The Mentor. Like the traditional cards, this may be played when you have Leia and Chewie together in a battle. Your benefit is 2 added battle destiny. This is an impressive twist, as all other of the destiny-adding teamwork cards involve Luke. In a Teamwork-based deck, this can surprise an opponent who expects these powerful interrupts only from combinations involving Luke. And no one can deny the power of an extra 2 destiny in a battle, especially in a high destiny deck, as a Teamwork deck tends to be.\\par \\par The extra text is quite useful. In fact, I'd venture to say that it is the most powerful yet. It allows you, if Leia is in a battle, to forfeit Chewie from your hand to satisfy all battle damage and attrition. This is quite nasty in conjunction with a few other cards. Obviously, you can use this to keep a squad of characters on the Death Star while your opponent is forced to lose some of his built up defense, but there are more subtle strategies.\\par \\par One is an odd twist on the familiar Ghhhk strategy. One would play a lone TIE Fighter at a system and drain. When the opponent deployed there, he would play a Lone Pilot and then Ghhhk to avoid the damage. You can do something similar with this, and, in fact, the effect is much more devastating. With Princess Leia on the table, if you play Warrior's Courage, you get 3 battle destiny when she's alone. Then, simply play Protector, and lose Chewie, and she stays on the table. Doubly effective if she's been trained, or if she's carrying a Lightsaber.\\par \\par The added cancelling ability can be useful as well, cancelling two very annoying interrupts. Frustration can be a pain in a deck designed for it, and cancelling I'd Just As Soon Kiss A Wookiee can be an added reassurance that your cards are going to get into play.",

An opinion that some top ranked players hold is that Vader is wasted in space when compared with his devastating effectiveness at sites. Uncontrollable Fury is another tool in this war. While there is a Dark Side card that can cancel it, the power of Uncontrollable Fury probably makes it more than worth the risk.\\par \\par There are numerous avoidance strategies that can make use of the Force loss part of the card. The easiest of these is just to use Nabrun Leids to move away from Vader in each of the Dark Side's battle phases, and cause them to lose two Force per opponent's turn. Of course, that requires the Dark player to use Vader, but he is usually to good to pass up.\\par -----\\par Dark side card against direct damage: Imperial Decree (V6).",

    "Information": "When using this card as a Used Interrupt, you may search your Used Pile. Doesn't sound overly interesting. However, after deploying something like an Executor, or a normal star destroyer with pilots, you should have an interesting Used Pile. If you have plenty weapons in your deck, chances are good that you find a weapon there. This is also a very strong point, as you can take ONE weapon. It does not specify which weapon. Find a Superlaser there ? Take it. Vader needs his custom slice-toy and it's in the Used Pile ? Pick out Vader's Lightsaber and take it into your hand. Want to arm that star destroyer ? Weapon Levitate the Turbolaser Battery or Ion Cannon you see in your Used Pile. The possibilities are only limited by the weapons in your deck.\\par \\par There is another use, the Lost Interrupt variant. For fun I'll give an example which actually happened. I had an unarmed Darth Vader at a site. Here comes Obi-Wan with a generic Jedi Lightsaber (his own toy was not deployed yet). Obi starts to battle and suddenly he feels the lightsaber wrenched from his grip, sees it flying through the room and into Darth Vaders hands. The last thing Obi-Wan ever saw, was Darth Vader slicing him with Obi's own surrogate toy.\\par \\par In the game, Obi-Wan started the battle and I played Weapon Levitation as a Lost Interrupt. I snatched the Jedi Lightsaber and, as it can be used by any warrior, used it to slice Obi-Wan to ribbons. However, things get a little more interesting. The game text states, that you may 'steal' one character weapon present. OK, so you will not run off with a Planet Defender Ion Cannon. However, did you see Luke waving his Blaster Pistol (and you fear he will target you, to make Darth lose the immunity to attrition) ? 'Steal' the pistol. It is a character weapon. Do you see Djas Puhr against a Light Side character with a Blaster Rifle and your opponent starts the fight ? Use Weapon Levitation to 'steal' the rifle. You see, the great part is, that neither specific weapons, nor specific characters are mentioned. Any character of ability >3 can steal any character weapon (so you might even get a weapon back thet the Light Side once stole from you !).\\par \\par In short, a good card to include in any deck, especially if you have a lot of weapons, a lot of ability 4+ characters, ... or both.\\par \\par Strong points:\\par * Weapon Levitation = Destiny 4 - good to upgrade average destiny, good to draw destiny.\\par * Weapon Levitation = Two cards for the price of one (Used and Lost variant).\\par * Weapon Levitation = Uncommon, thus it should not be too hard to get.\\par * Weapon Levitation = Surprise, as in, surprise your opponent by using his weapons against him, or at least get your weapons fast.\\par \\par \\par Weak points:\\par * Weapon Levitation = Not immune, so a Sense could ruin this little plan.\\par * Weapon Levitation = Unique.

This is very obnoxious to do after Mara or Son Of Skywalker has used their \"once per game\" ability. Putting an opponent's lightsaber into the Used Pile is beneficial since it takes away the Force drain bonus for the following turn, and it removes the battle / duel advantage that a saber provides. Also, late in the game, you can put one of your lightsabers into your Used Pile to help boost your differential. As a Lost Interrupt, this works even better for this purpose, as you may place any or all of your devices and character weapons on table into your Used Pile. These counterparts are a must in any deck utilizing a quantity of devices and character weapons, and allows them to be used without the disadvantage of being too card-intensive.

These cards show relationships between Light Side characters at vulnerable moments. Scruffy Looking Nerf Herder is the first and best-known of these tension cards. In Scruffy Looking Nerf Herder, Leia and Han's usual strong bond hits a weak spot and allows the Dark Side to draw two destiny and to subtract that amount from the Light Side opponent's attrition and total power.\\par \\par Since every Light Side deck uses Luke in one form or another, including a card to counter an opponent using one of the personas of Luke is a good idea.
