    "Information": "Article on DeckTech, August 19th, 2007 '2nd Annual SWCCG Encyclopedia of Decks' by Brandon \"Jabba_the_Ruck\" Ruck\\par http://www.decktech.net/starwarsccg/articles/articles.php?id=6526&view=2\\par \\par Popular Cards to Look For: Great Shot Kid!, Squadron Assignments, Strike Planning, Luke Skywalker (V1), R2 In Red 5, Advanced Preparation (V3), The Time For Our Attack Has Come (V7), Mon Mothma (V9), Yavin sites, and big starships.\\par \\par Idea Behind Objective: Yet again, it's a movie objective. This one has only gotten better as the game has continued. When it was release in 2000, it was a very very difficult objective to play out. It simply took too many card slots to just blow the Death Star and almost none of them could be pulled from reserve. Plus, it deployed a lot of cards and had no form of retrieval. To fix the problems the deck had, five cards were made that completely change how effective the deck can be. They are Great Shot Kid!, Advanced Preparation (V3), Rebel Tech (V3), Luke Skywalker (V1) and most recently Mon Mothma (V9)). All of these cards have helped to bring this objective back to the tournament scene. In order to blow the Death Star, you have to get Luke there. If he is going to last long enough without being killed in battle, he has to complete the Attack Run the same turn he makes it to the Death Star. That means that you either have to deploy there directly with a spy ship (or the Tantive IV (V7)) or be carried over on a Nebulon-B Frigate (Death Star 2 expansion). Using these options, you can still move Luke into the Trench.\\par \\par How It Can Win: The deck can win very easily once you blow the Death Star because when that happens, the DS takes a BIG direct hit for 14 Force. Many good dark decks deploy so many cards (CCT, Scum, Ralops) giving them a loss that big can literally cripple them to the point of losing every game. After dishing out the damage, the fun begins. From then on out, one per turn you get to deploy ANY starship you want for free from hand or Reserve and you also get to retrieve 3 Force EVERYTIME you deploy a starship thanks to Great Shot Kid. So Home One goes down for free, then gets killed, then retrieved, and played again for free. This deck totally rules the stars. You will be able to over-power any DS space no matter what deck they are playing leaving you solid +2 drains at systems with piloted starfighters.\\par \\par What Changed Since 1st Edition: The biggest change to this deck happened shortly after the 1st Edition of this Encyclopia was posted. A version of MBO was created that could auto-blow the Death Star by turn 2 or 3 every single game. The two reasons for this new achievement was the creation of Mon Mothma (V9) combined with The Time For Our Attack Has Come (V8). Plus the version plays 5x Control Combo and 5x All Wings Combo. The pre Redux version of Mothma (V9) allowed you to add +4 to the Epic Event draw. So when you combine that with Luke Skywalker (V1) adding +7, you auto hit on the Epic Event draw unless you drew two 1s. The reason this deck worked was rather than having to draw both Luke and the way to get him there; you can pull TTFOAHC (V8) with the Don't Do That Again Shield. Then, set up Mothma (V9) and General Rieekan (V4) on Yavin 4 sites. Rieekan pulls Tigran Jamiro (V4) to flip and pulls Haven on Yavin 4. Using the Squadron Assignments and All Wings Combo, you get Luke on Red 5 to Yavin with any other ship. Then play TTFOAHC (V8) to deploy the Nebulon-B Frigate from under your starting effect. This ship can carry two starfighters. So you use the Frigate to move Luke over to the Death Star System so he can blow the Death Star. Then use the TTFOAHC (V8) to move the Frigate an additional time that turn back to Yavin 4. This new method auto pulls the ship that gets Luke there and the way to get them back. Plus, since you set up Haven at Yavin, even if they Barrier Luke or the Frigate, you will usually be safe with the 2 destinies from Haven for the one turn you wait before taking out the Death Star. The first version of this deck was totally broken and could not be beat by almost anything. It came out when the Endor Back Door Effects were still the original broken versions. That's One (V9) allowed you to cancel a battle anywhere on table, not just at Chewie's location like it is now. So if the DS tried to battle Luke or the guys on the ground, they were automatically stopped. Since the Re Edit, the deck no longer adds +4 from Mothma (V9) and lost the turn of protection from That's One (V9). Since you can't auto hit anymore, the deck is Forced to set up extra sites and have a Rebel Tech (V2) on table for adding to the total. The rest of the deck is still solid, but can lose to decks that set up fast and have the ability to kill the characters on Yavin early.\\par \\par Why I SHOULD Play It: With a new design, MBO can be a powerful option for LS and is still the worst matchup for one of the strongest DS decks, SYCFA Fear. This is still true even though Maneuver Check (V12) says you can't move ships the same turn they are deployed. You still have the ability to set up the draw and cause big damage. Once you flip, you can retrieve your whole lost pile and take on any DS space package currently bothering you. After flipping, this deck can win by either space beatdown or simply out draining. There is no limit to the amount of retrieval per turn as long as you can pay for it. Besides Hidden Base, this is probably the only deck where you really don't need to ever go to the ground once you have flipped. The deck usually just plays with EPPs to strike a character on the ground and then get retrieved. If you want, you can play with the <> Forest to just pile all of the EPPs there so they have weapons and are completely immune to attrition. The deck can be very easy to play because you do the same thing every single game. Flip, blow up Death Star, and have fun.\\par \\par Why NOT to Play It: If the Death Star takes more than five turns to blow, you will almost always lose. It can also lose if you take too long flipping the objective and too long to get Luke over to the Death Star. Then the DS is going to be draining and causing the key cards to fall into the lost pile. Two cards can still hurt this deck; Sense Combo and Imperial Barrier. I can't tell you how many games I have played where I have everything I need to blow it and my opponent plays Sense/Uncertain Is The Future to completely change my hand and Force me to start all over. It also hurts when you are trying to flip and one of your guy gets Barriered at the docking bay, only to then get beatdown next turn. Since the auto-win has left this deck, many choose other more reliable options for LS. If you are not good at playing this deck, it can easily beat itself. So make sure if you take on MBO, that you get a good number of practice games in, especially the beginning turns for flipping and blowing the Death Star.",

It allows you to literally recreate the blowing up of Alderaan. The deck can be built many different ways. When it came out, it was built as a Mains and Toys platform because at the time, it provided the largest amount of activation of any DS deck. It also allowed you to pull additional Death Star sites for even more activation. For a short time, there was the Brangus Glee deck based around this objective. With the introduction of V cards, the deck became even more powerful with the creation of Fear Will Keep Them In Line (V2). Fear deploys on the Death Star and deals out direct damage of 2 for each battleground system you control with a Star Destroyer. This means SYCFA Fear is the fastest way to set up large amounts of direct damage. When building this deck, you have to decide if you want to flip or not. The majority of versions will not flip since the zero side protects the DS from beatdown at the Death Star sites. SYCFA is the best platform for ANY DS space deck because you can set up Darth Sidious or Emperor Palpatine at the docking bay to drain for free. Since both those characters are immune to attrition, the only way the LS can remove them is with a weapon or by canceling their game text or immunity to attrition. The majority of current LS decks will have no way to cancel the immunity to attrition and will use weapons to try to eliminate these characters, so the best way to keep your characters on the table is with Force Field or Lightsaber Parry. LP can only be played if your Dark Jedi has a lightsaber as well. Since you don't care about fighting at the docking bay, Force Field can be the best way to protect your characters from lightsabers. Since both of the Dark Jedi characters you would use are ability 7, the LS will have a much harder time hitting them with non-lightsaber weapons. Some builds use Wipe Them Out, All Of Them (V9) to protect the Dark Jedi from permanent weapons. If you do decide to flip the objective, you will lose the protection from battle damage, thus losing your best Tech to get around Battle Plan/Order. The seven side does provide bonuses in space. The biggest being the +2 to Force drains at systems you control with a Star Destroyers. If you combine this with FWKTIL (V2), you can deal out MAJOR damage with little fear of beatdown since there is no way for the LS to make your starships forfeit 0.\\par \\par How It Can Win: This deck wins by setting up Star Destroyers at systems to drain, then playing FWKTIL (V2). If you do play with FWKTIL (V), you will not be able to play Kuat Drive Yards (V6) to pull the systems. To find the systems you have two choices. One is playing with Voyeur (V5) to deploy any battleground or you can play with Commander Merrejk who can simply pull the systems while present at a Scomp Link. Once the systems and Destroyers are in place, there is nothing left to do but wait and cause damage. If the LS is not playing with much space, you should have an easy victory. The standard LS space package with non-space based decks is any combination of Home One, Tantive IV (V7), Bright Hope (V6), Spiral, Gold Leader in Gold 1 (V10), and HC&F. Besides doing a lot of damage with drains and Fear damage, the deck can set up HUGE beatdowns. When building this deck, you have to decide rather you want to play 10 to 12 Destroyers with more red cards to work them OR 16 to 26 Destroyers for large amounts of beatdown. The second version usually plays half unique and half non-unique. The idea is the same, set up on at least one starship at each system, sit back and wait. Once the LS goes to space, you can beatdown with multiple ships or powerful Interrupts and Effects. The most popular Effect for this deck will always be Lateral Damage making the opponent's ship power AND forfeit zero. The easiest way to beatdown the LS in space is by preventing their movement. The LS has many ways around having to battle in space and stopping that is important. Once you deployed your squad to fight, you should play Gravity Shadow or They've Shut Down the Main Reactor if they try to move away. GS requires you to draw destiny greater than the pilots ability of a LS starship that just began to move away. This is great if they have more than one ship together, you can wait until they move one away, then trap the other one. Since they already moved, they will not be able to move back to protect the ship. Since you have to draw destiny, this is not a guaranteed way to stop them. TSDTMR only works at systems where your Destroyer has a weapon or tractor beam. The upside is all you have to do is pay 2 Force and it works automatically on the ship being targeted. Besides prevent the movement of the ship, TSDTMR also says the ship may not apply ability toward drawing destiny. It is also a USED Interrupt over Gravity Shadow which is LOST. GS is also restricted to being played only after the opponent decided to move, while TSDTMR can be played ANY phase on ANY turn. The other reason to go with TSDTMR is because the beams can be deployed from your Starting Effect with Levitation Attack (V6), while weapons have to be in your Reserve deck itself. When you combine the damage from Fear with this ability to almost auto beatdown ANY LS space deck, you can see why SYCFA is currently one of the strongest and most powerful options for the DS.\\par \\par What Changed Since 1st Edition: SYCFA Fear has only gotten stronger with each Virtual set. The creation of Endor Shield (V11) totally changed how this deck was built. The original version required the deck to play multiples of Commander Merrejk plus an average of 2 to 4 Imperial Commands to pull him. ES (V11) can be started and just pulls Merrejk first turn. So your deck is freed up slots for more starships or red cards. Since it pulls two characters, you can also set up Admiral Chiraneau automatically for higher drains. The Re Edit also only helped the deck by removing all of its worst match-ups; Speeders, MBO, TRMs, and WYS (V9). All of them used to give SYCFA a hard game. Now, each one is either gone totally from the tournament scene or just not as strong as it used to be. Speeders lost a turn of T-47 Battle Formation, takes many more turns longer to set up, and now requires the LS to occupy Hoth locations to limit the direct damage. MBO used to be an auto flip and would blow up the Death Star no later than turn 3. Now the draw is no longer automatic and can be slowed down with Maneuvering Check (V12) preventing their starship from moving the turn it was deployed. TRMs took a hit with Wipe Them Out, All of Them (V10) hurting the EPPs weapon destiny draw, making it almost impossible to hit the Dark Jedi at the docking bay unless they have control of another battleground site. WYS (V9) was a very hard match-up, and now no longer even exists as it did before since the Re Edit totally remade what the objective did. SYCFA can setup fast with Dreaded Imperial Starfleet (V9) making ALL DS capital ships deploy -2 while you have more DS systems on table. Since the non-unique Imperial Class Star Destroyers deploy -3 to a system where you have a unique Destroyer, they deploy for 3 EACH. All of these changes to the game have elevated SYCFA Fear to one of THE most powerful options for DS. Currently, whenever a LS deck is built, it has to consider how well it would do against SYCFA Fear to know if it can win a major tournament. A counter card was released in virtual set 13. The counter card is Alderaan (Blown Away) (V13) which causes you to flip SYCFA to the seven side. The impact of this card on the tournament scene is not known right now but several LS decks can take advantage of this card; TRMs and Hidden Base being two of the obvious choices. The DS now can not count on their objective being on the zero side all game unless they take into account this new card. Some other help the LS got from the new V sets and Re Edit was Han's Toolkit (V11) and Red Squadron 7 (V12). Han's Toolkit (V11) deploys on Han or Falcon, while Han is piloting the Falcon at a battleground, ALL Effects for both sides that are not immune to Alter are suspended (excluding POTF, Empeor's Power, and S&D). This means as long as you can keep the Falcon with Han alive, Fear does NO damage. The best option for this would be at Bespin: Cloud City since no capital ships can deploy there. Red Squadron 7 (V12) is the matching x-wing for either Corran Horn or Keir Santage. This new LS starship can once per game put a non-immune to Alter Effect at same system in owner's used pile. The ability of this ship only happens once and only provides the LS a way to get the Fear (V2) Effect off the table for at least a turn. Since Corran Horn is a spy, the x-wing can deploy directly to the Death Star.\\par \\par Why I SHOULD Play It: This deck has the biggest reason to play it over any other for DS. At the moment, SYCFA Fear is literally the worst match-up for more LS strategies than any other deck. The ability to set up damage of 10 from just the card Fear alone and then drain for 6 to 8 in one turn means this deck does A LOT of damage. Then you add the power of the Star Destroyers which all have forfeit of 9 with their power of 7 to 9 each and the LS has a very hard time knocking you out of space. Then the objective provides the ability to set up your drain for free while being totally protected from beatdown. This means you can focus the whole deck on working well in space. The LS has no space based deck that can do everything this deck can. Even if you come up against a very heavy space oriented Hidden Base, you will usually have way more ships than they do and, if they play with ground, they had to use way more card slots to set it up and hold it against all the various types of DS ground strategies. The majority of LS space decks will have to pay to drain while you drain for free with no worry. A few of your extra slots are usually for 2 or 3 Undercover spies, which provide a few turns of drain protection while the LS tries to find Corran Horn. Arica, U-3P0, and Kedar the Black are the most popular. Even if you don't want to play with Destroyers, SYCFA is a great platform for a TIE Swarm deck. You can set up Sienar Fleet Systems on Wakeelmui automatically with Crossfire (V9). Mob Points Combo pulls Wakeelmui, so all of that can be set up first turn. SFS lets you retrieve a card WHENEVER you deploy a TIE and even lets you get 3 cards when you deploy a Squadron. You still drain for free at the bay, so the TIEs can set up fast drains and play All Powers to Weapons to get +2 in power and total immunity to attrition. Since you aren't playing with as many Destroyers, you can play the non-V Dreaded Imperial Starfleet to cancel drains. When you combine DIS and the Death Star Gunner trick with Strategic Reserves you would be canceling two drains a turn, plus retrieving. The TIEs don't have the solid power or Fear damage the Destroyers have but set up much faster with Kuat Drive Yard (V6) pulling all the systems. Combined with the retrieval, either version can be a solid choice for DS. Of course, the main SYCFA Fear with the Destroyers is currently the best version to go with.\\par \\par Why NOT to Play It: The Re Edit changed what hurts this deck. Besides a quick MBO, there is no real auto loss for this deck. All the current strategies for LS have problems with some aspect of SYCFA Fear. In order to keep Fear damage going all game, it is important to always play at least 2 to 4 Controls in the deck to cancel Alter or Imperial Atrocity(V6). When one of these is played to the table, it can auto absorb 3 in your direct damage. WHAP relies on this card to have a chance of beating SYCFA since they don't usually play any space. The most popular ways to beat this deck are setting up ground damage as fast as possible while the DS is setting up. It will usually take SYCFA Fear at least three turns before it is ready to do serious Fear damage. This means the Obi start decks can sometimes be a problem since they start the game with a drain of 2 to 3. Since this deck doesn't play any real ground, the LS can spread out early and do damage without having to deploy a lot of characters. The LS can play I Hope She's Alright (Search & Destroy for LS) to cause direct damage before Sidious hits the table. Padme (V11) does another 2 direct damage while non-Jedi Luke and Leia are on table. It is always important to play Imperial Decree (V6) in any build of SYCFA for any LS deck that relies on direct damage to win the game i.e. WHAP, Profit, and Speeders mainly. The key for beating SYCFA Fear is keeping the Fear (V2) Effect off the table, keeping some presence in space, and/or knocking the Dark Jedi off the docking bay. Having to pay for drains can really hurt since the unique Destroyers can still be costly. This deck can also be beat with Mantellian Savrip. The LS can stay alive in space to drain for free as long as Savrip stays on the table. Remember to always play at least one if not two Masterful Move (non-combo) to keep Savrip off the table. No Celebration will stay in play with this deck, so you have no reason to play the combo. The DS always has the advantage over the average LS space package with this deck even when you aren't doing much Fear damage early. Once you knock all their ships off the table, as long as you drain for free, you should have no problem winning the game. The impact to SYCFA of Alderaan (Blown Away) (V13) is not yet known. It isn't known whether that card will be a staple in all LS decks, how it makes the DS play SYCFA, or if the card will never see play.",
