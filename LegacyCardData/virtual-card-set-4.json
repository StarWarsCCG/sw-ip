There are more Jedi that see play than Dark Jedi, and many have little immunity or none at all, which can mean guaranteed Force loss. This card is not meant to stay on the table, but cycle through your deck to show up as a big destiny draw or to deploy again for more Force loss. This works well w/ #1 as well, since you can't fire with your EPPs. The attrition reduction is a two-edged sword; so make sure you have some fodder. I can't tell you how many times it has turned a weak destiny draw into a site clearer. A great card that is fun to use along with other battle winning cards like Insignificant Rebellion.\\par \\par ARMAEDES' TAKE:\\par I agree completely with your assessment of the strengths of this card. The light side version made my list, but for dark side I just think there's far better battling helpers available. The strength of most of the powerful light side decks is EPP hit-and-run. I really only see the dark side version of this card being useful if you keep it on the table for a turn, so your opponent loses a Force from their EPP strike, or if you are going against an immunity-mains deck like Profit, which is unpopular at best, or the Careful Planning (V) Endor deck, which this card would work quite well against.",

    "Information": "Player Created Card\\par Original concept by Kevin Brwonell,\\par Illinois Staes, 2004.\\par -----\\par Article on DeckTech, August 19th, 2007 '2nd Annual SWCCG Encyclopedia of Decks' by Brandon \"Jabba_the_Ruck\" Ruck\\par http://www.decktech.net/starwarsccg/articles/articles.php?id=6526&view=2\\par \\par Tatooine w/ Combat Readiness (V8) (Scum)\\par \\par Starting Location(s): Tatooine: Jabba's Palace (Starting Location), Tatooine system, Jabba's Palace: Dungeon\\par \\par Popular Cards to Look For: Jabba the Hutt (V8), Hutt Bounty (V8), Power of the Hutt, Jabba's Influence (V6), None Shall Pass (V8), Imperial Barrier, Ellis, Tatooine Maul, Bounty Hunters\\par \\par Idea Behind Design: DS Tatooine CR (V8) will always be known as 'Scum.' This amazing strategy started when the original V8 Combat Readiness (V8) allowed you to start the system, Palace, and AC to start the game. Then with added help from V8 Effects and characters, the broken Scum deck was born. The combination of these cards made this DS option more powerful than any other DS strategy at the time. Much like the 'Back Door' Effects for LS, many of the original V8 cards that made this deck too powerful were changed in the Redux and Re Edit of the Virtual sets. The most powerful cards were Hutt's Bounty (V8), Jabba the Hutt (V8) and Jabba's Space Cruiser (V8). The worst of them being Hutt's Bounty (V8) because it provided the deck with extra activation, +1 bonus to total battle destiny, and the ability to reduce ANY character's power to 0 once per turn at the same site as a Gangster which was the most powerful part of the card. The Gangster didn't even have to be in the battle to hurt the LS character. There was no way around this card short of playing Alter. The problem was that the card could be redeployed next turn with All Wrapped Up (V8) pulling any card with Bounty in title. The deck itself was a perfect machine and provided all the necessary mechanics for playing against just about any LS deck. It could even give the broken virtual WYS (V8) deck a run for it's money back when that strategy was going strong. The deck gets its name from one of its most important cards, Scum and Villainy. That card made 90% of the characters deploy -1 and let you retrieve 2 Force whenever you initiated battle. The Re Edit changed all of the broken cards from Scum. Jabba no longer doubles all aliens present, just one non-maintenance alien present. As a bonus, he can pull Scum & Villainy once per turn rather than once per game. Hutt Bounty (V8) can no longer be pulled by All Wrapped Up (V8) and must deploy on Jabba himself, so you can't pull it with Crossfire (V9) either. It still adds +1 to total battle destiny but only adds the activation bonus to Jabba's Palace sites you occupy, and only non-Jedi characters may be made Power zero. Plus it only works at Jabba's site and not for any Gangster. While Jabba's Space Cruiser (V8) was also a very powerful card, it was not altered in the Redux. The PC changed the rule on capital ships being able to deploy without a pilot. So you couldn't just deploy it with Power Of The Hutt for it to sit there until you add the right characters or the defensive cards.\\par \\par How It Can Win: Scum will always be a powerful option for DS because it uses the same tools the other DS alien based objectives use to win games. All of the new Virtual cards for aliens can benefit this deck. There are several reasons that the non-objective Scum can be a better choice over just playing Court Of The Vile Gangster, Black Sun, MKOS, or CCT aliens. Since you can start the game with both the system and Jabba's Palace on table, you never have to worry about defending sites outside of the Palace. The start of the game is always the same. Get out Jabba the Hutt (V8) to the Audience Chamber, set up S&V, maybe add Ephant Mon with Power of the Hutt, and wait. The following turns have you setting up aliens at different Jabba's Palace sites to both drain and cause direct damage with Tatooine Occupation. Unlike other DS alien decks, this one plays ONLY Jabba's Palace sites. They use None Shall Pass (V8) to prevent any LS character (other than Leia) from deploying to a JP site. Combine that with Imperial Barriers and the LS can have a lot of trouble invading the Palace. The original version usually played the Palace, Audience Chamber, and Lower Passages (all Jabba's Palace battlegrounds that provided two icons). The new CR (V8) only lets you have 5 total icons to start the game, so if you want to stay set up within Jabba's Palace, you have to play the Dungeon, Rancor Pit, or Entrance. The Dungeon makes the best option since you already capture with Boba Fett (V8), IG-88 with Gun, Snoova with Axe, or Hidden Weapons. Just like all DS aliens decks based on Tatooine, you should always use Gailid to the AC to add +1 to Force drains at all JP sites. Once set up, the deck can win two ways; either by sitting back causing damage or by battling and causing overflow. The deck greatly relies on S&V + Jabba staying in play to win. While this might seem simple for the LS to thwart, the LS has to be playing the counters for getting into the Palace without being weak to either beatdown or capture. Since the change of Hutt Bounty (V8), this is not as hard as it was when Mace, Obi, or Qui-Gon could be made power 0.\\par \\par What Change Since 1st Edition: Much like WYS (V8), this was probably the deck that had the biggest change from its original design. Besides the cards mentioned previously, the deck also took a hit with Jabba's Influence (V6) being changed. The original version made ALL bounty hunters power +2 and allowed the DS player to deploy any non-bounty hunter alien from Reserve Deck ONCE PER TURN while Jabba was on table. The Re Edit changed the card to provide power +1 to bounty hunters, and the once per turn was changed to once per game. Since the change to the original version made it so you couldn't pull aliens every turn any more, the speed beatdown aspect of the deck changed. Despite the changes, there are more than a few players that are totally in love with Scum and continue to play it even today. The new versions still start Jabba's Influence (V6), Power of the Hutt, and a random third Effect. While the previous version always started All Wrapped Up (V8) to pull Hutt Bounty (V8), the new version will start Crossfire (V9) to pull either Occupation for damage or Security Precautions (V4) for additional activation while also getting around Goo Nee Tay. The basic idea remains the same, set up Jabba with your aliens to fight LS. Scum will always be a very interactive deck because it has the ability to go after every LS deck that plays ground characters. It also usually leaves characters on table for the LS to battle. The space remains the same with the Space Cruiser (V8) leading the pack, supported by Mist Hunter (V5), Maul's Ship, and either Punishing One (V5) or Hound's Tooth (V5) depending on the player. Tatooine Maul has become standard in most Scum decks since he doesn't suspend S&V while he is piloting in space. He also provides the deck the option of playing SAC for adding protection.\\par \\par Why I SHOULD Play It: This new design of CR (V8) Scum is still being played today. Many still find the overall strategy around the Jabba's Palace sites to be one of the best options for DS. While Mace (V9) can always be a problem if he is able to deploy to the AC, the majority of games played will see the LS trying to do their own strategy. Scum works best if it can be on the offensive side of the game. If the LS is able to constantly pressure the AC with characters, Scum will usually have a much harder game. Any LS deck that has a specific strategy can be hard pressed against Scum. The DS can set up good activation after the first turn and they still have Power of the Hutt to pull characters. Plus if you don't play with SAC or counters for None Shall Pass (V8), the LS can waste turns of Force by trying to deploy to the Palace sites. No Bargain can be a good card that adds +2 to deploy of Rebels while no Imperials are at Palace sites. If you also play Bad Feeling Have I, Jedi Luke would cost 12 Force, then goes to the bottom of Force pile from None Shall Pass (V8). The Re Edit did change how broken Scum used to be but the basic strategy around DS aliens can still be very very powerful. The Re Edit also removed the problem decks that Scum used to have troubles with. TRMs was the worst match-up since their whole strategy was to disrupt the DS strategy. While you will still see TRMs being played, the deck is not as popular since the creation of Wipe Them Out, All of Them (V12). Still the DS player has to actually play the card to see any benefit from it. Virtual WYS (V8) could also beat Scum and it no longer even exists as a playable deck. While the LS continues to be the weaker side right now, any DS alien based platform will have a good chance of winning. Should you decide to give Scum a try, there are TONS of posted versions currently on Decktech.\\par \\par Why NOT to Play It: Scum can be beat. While it was almost impossible to beat it before, this new version is by no means unbeatable. The biggest weaknesses will always be the space because they don't play the deck to battle in space but on the ground. Just like all DS alien decks, they play enough to stay alive in space to drain for free and keep the LS space package on edge. Decks like Hidden Base Quads can win once the entire space package has been lost, you won't have Occupation and will be forced to pay to both drain and retrieve cards all game. Scum can lose to MWYHL is it is not able to cause enough damage fast enough before the LS is ready to come after them. The Asteroid version of MWYHL can be hard for Scum to beat since they are able to cause damage all game and none of the DS ships will survive the fields with some tracking. Scum always has to worry about TRMs since all TRMs does is battle and go to the Palace constantly the whole game. Scum can also have trouble with the new AITC Obi deck or D!ck Hat. Since Obi starts the game already in play, he is already set up to disrupt the aliens. While you can still win games with this deck, the DS has more powerful options that have fewer bad match-ups. Although nothing I could ever say about this deck would make some players stop playing it.\\par \\par -----\\par \\par Bespin w/ Combat Readiness (V8)\\par \\par Starting Location(s): Any Bespin battleground site (Starting Location), Bespin system, Cloud City: Security Tower, Docking Bay, or Dining Hall\\par \\par Popular Cards to Look For: Executor, Lando (V6), They Must Never Again Leave This City, Tractor Beams, Overloads, AT-ATs, Endor Shield (V11).\\par \\par Idea Behind Design: Bespin CR (V8) was another deck that took a big hit with the Re Edit. One of the strongest things going for DS was the ability to start Bespin, Cloud City, and another 2 icon site. When you played the Weather Vane (V6), your total activation from just your cards was 9!!! The original CR (V8) also let you start 4 Effects, so you could start with We're the Bait (V6) (for pulling Free Executor Effect They Must Never Again Leave This City), Mob Points Combo, Vane (V6), and another random Effect. Since you activated so much Force, it was very easy to set up Maul, Executor, and even Lando (V6) first turn. In most games, the LS just deploys stuff to set up and doesn't battle, so you could always get a card stacked on Firepower (V6) or retrieve the CR (V8) to play in the game. The best strategy going for this set up was getting either EPP Maul or Maul YA + Stick to the Cloud City: Chasm. For those that don't know, the Chasm text says ANY hit character is Immediately relocated to the Weather Vane (V6). The Vane (V6) said any new character coming to the Vane causes 1 Force loss. At the beginning of each player's Control Phase, any character on the Vane would have to relocate to any Cloud City site. If a bounty hunter was on Cloud City, that character is immediately captured. Capturing can only happen by the DS so it never mattered if Maul got hit because he was just relocated back to the Chasm on the DS player's next turn. Since Maul gets two swings it was very easy to send multiple characters to the Vane. It was impossible for the LS to beatdown Maul as long as he was able to constantly 'hit' the characters trying to come after him. This idea was a very solid strategy for DS because it was VERY fast and made it difficult for the LS to defeat Maul at the Chasm. The Re Edit completely changed the possibility for this deck. We're The Bait (V6) was changed to no longer be immune to Alter, so the purpose of playing the card was lost. The card can still pull any card with \"Bespin\" or \"Cloud City\" in lore or game text but since you are not able to start it, the point of playing the card is almost gone. To make it at least helpful, the new version also cancels It's A Trap. The Weather Vane (V6) no longer causes 1 Force loss when characters are placed there. The rest of the deck is pretty much the same. The biggest change was with CR (V8) which no longer starts 4 Effects and was changed to no longer be able to start Cloud City. Since you can't start the Sector, there is no point in playing the rest of the deck. So with one swift stroke, the deck lost the activation, Vane (V6) power, and easy setup of the Free Executor like CCT. Besides the Vane (V6) version of Bespin CR (V8), the other design came from a speed version of Dark Deal. Since you could still do the same thing as the Vane version by starting the system, sector, and site, it was very easy to play a deck that could set up Dark Deal by turn 1 if you got the right cards. Since the Re Edit has changed how this deck can be played, the popularity of using Bespin with CR (V8) has dropped greatly.\\par \\par How It Can Win: Much like Endor CP (V8) for LS, this deck went from being VERY strong to almost not being played. Currently the only version being played, that I know of, is completely space based. Your goal is to still set up the Free Executor. This time your starting sites are the Lower Corridor because it is -1 Force drain and the Security Tower. You still start Mob Points Combo, Dreaded Imperial Starfleet (V9), and Endor Shield (V11). In order to have a chance of deploying the Executor first turn, you have to play 2 to 3 copies of TMNALTC and 3x We Must Accelerate Our Plans. You still pull the Executor with Mob Points, so in most games you should be able to have the Executor in play no later than turn two. You always pull Lando (V6) with the Tower before you activate. If you don't draw either card to play the Executor, use a search of your Reserve Deck for something and see if one of them ended up in your Force pile. If so, just draw up until you have it. Once the Executor is in play, you get Lando (V6) and Captain Bewil (V6) on the Executor. From there you set up a Tractor Beam and Deflector Shield Generator (V4) on the Executor with Levitation Attack (V6). The Endor Shield (V11) is there to pull Admiral Chirneau and Thrawn creating the super Executor. This doesn't have the damage the SYCFA Fear does but it does have other things going for it. Instead of using many Star Destroyers or a strategy based around the Death Star, this deck can use those extra card slots for more tricks. The main strategy for this deck is beatdown. You use a combination of In Range, They've Shutdown the Main Reactor, and Lateral Damage to create HUGE beatdowns against the LS. The vast majority of LS decks have no counters for Tractor Beams, so once they decide to deploy to space to either stop your drains or drain for free them, you set up the kill. For example, the LS deploys Bright Hope (V5) and Tantive IV (V7), very very common these days. If the Executor is in range, you can move in front of them after deploying a few more Star Destroyers and playing Lateral Damage targeting Tantive IV (V7). Then they have their turn. Sometime before their battle phase you play They've Shut Down the Main Reactor on Tantive IV (V7) to prevent it from moving and applying ability for drawing battle destiny. From here, the LS has ONE turn to fortify the two ships. They might have a Houjix or maybe they just deploy a bunch of ships to be forfeit. In any case, the LS will almost never battle you. Since they are unable to move the Tantive IV (V7), they are stuck waiting for the next turn. On the following turn, you can deploy even more stuff and battle. You play In Range to capture the Bright Hope (V5) if they didn't deploy stuff to Tantive IV (V7). Once you capture Bright Hope (V5), Tantive IV (V7) will be left to the wolves with no destiny, no power and no forfeit. So they will lose WHATEVER your total power is. GG if they don't have a Houjix. Nothing you set up with this deck is all that hard, it's just different from the standard DS deck you might see.\\par \\par What Changed Since 1st Edition: As mentioned earlier, this deck changed completely with the Re Edit. It can be said that Bespin CR (V8) is seen less often than even Endor CP (V8). All the previously popular ideas around any viable Bespin CR (V8) no longer seem to exist. Only new ideas like the one posted in the previous section are seen. This entire deck entry could be considered a change from the original. All I can say is it was nice while it lasted. As far as other options for playing this deck, the most recent has come from I'm Sorry (V12), which can pull Clouds from Reserve to set up on any system. If you want to try and set this up without using the Dark Deal Objective, there might be a solid strategy out there. I'm Sorry (V12) also pulls any Obsidian Squadron TIE, so you now have an Effect to set up a new strategy in the Clouds. If you play a similar setup with the battleground site and Security Tower, you would have a battleground site for draining for free plus a non-battleground site for putting the Tibanna Gas Miner, which adds +1 to Force drains at each Cloud sector. The Clouds have the power to set up huge drains very quickly. They also restrict deployment of Capital ships (unless the state they can deploy like starfighters), so your TIEs are safe from more than half the most popular LS starships being played today. This deck could still play the Free Executor or you could just use matching ships and Combat Response. One idea could set up Exterior Cloud City sites, then play AT-STs which React. You can set up Bespin Occupation on the system and do HUGE damage all game on multiple sites. You would have heavy drains + direct damage of 2 from Occupation and 1 from I'm Sorry (V12).\\par \\par Why I SHOULD Play It: The new Cloud idea may be the best option for Bespin CR (V8). The Clouds themselves have created a whole new problem for LS to deal with since they can only deploy starfighters, which can easily be shot down with SFS Laser Cannons on Tie Interceptors. You will also see Tallon Roll from regular TIE LNs. For years in the early days, Clouds had been very strong and hard to defend against. Since the game became so much faster, they were not seen since there was no way to search them out. Since I'm Sorry (V12) can finally search for both the Clouds and TIEs to deploy to the Clouds, there is no telling how popular this new strategy will become. Both the Cloud City and Special Edition sets have created multiple cards that benefit or provide bonuses to the Clouds. An entire deck type can be built around Bespin CR (V8) and I'm Sorry (V12). You can even build a new speed Dark Deal with those two cards. The original speed Dark Deal had to find the TIEs either with Combat Response for flashing matching ship/pilot or other cards that could pull TIEs. Now you still play the same strategy as before with ways to pull Cloud City sites, only you don't have to use as many card slots for the TIEs. It is possible a new speed Dark Deal will become popular as more players learn the strategy of these new cards. There have been many popular I'm Sorry (V12) versions of this deck posted on Decktech.\\par \\par Why NOT to Play It: Although the Clouds strategy has become a new option, Bespin CR (V8) has become just another option for a DS deck type. There is nothing about the deck that is just plain amazing like it was before. Some still choose to go with the Bespin Dark Deal Objective for setting up Cloud City sector over the new CR (V8) version described here. Much like the LS Endor CP (V8) deck, this one just isn't as good as it used to be. While you might see a random strategy come up, the popularity is just not there anymore. For the time being, keep your eyes open for how powerful the Cloud version might become. Until then, there might be more powerful choices for DS that would have a better chance of winning against more types of LS decks. Also, any deck that plays Clouds is going to deploy a good amount of cards to the table, so make sure you can set up big damage fast or you can get beat by LS decks that start dealing out damage quickly.\\par \\par -----\\par \\par Hoth w/ Combat Readiness (V8)\\par \\par Starting Locations: Hoth: 3rd Marker (Starting Location), Hoth system, another 1 icon Hoth site\\par \\par Popular Cards to Look For: Walkers, General Veers (V4), Veers (V10), Endor Shield (V11), Walker Garrison, Outflank (V9), Sunsdown, Whipids, J'Quille (V8)\\par \\par Idea Behind Design: Hoth CR (V8) has never been that popular as one of the set-ups for CR (V8). While there are many different strategies that can be played on Hoth, the other systems like Tatooine have seen more action. Since the creation of CR (V8), there have been two different ways to go when playing on Hoth. The main one is around Walkers since the Objective now only allows you to play Walker Garrison once per game. If you designed a deck around CR (V8), then you could play Walker Garrison as many times as you want in one game. Before the Re Edit changed CR (V8), you would start the Ice Plains and Mountains, thus allowing you to start You May Start Your Landing. This Effect can only be deployed if the Ice Plains (5th Marker) are already on table. Starting the Hoth: Warroom is a solution but seems to not be the best choice. The decked works much better being able to start the game with YMSYL because it pulls the 3rd Marker and one Walker Garrison already. Since you are able to play both Walker Garrison all game and Rebel Base Occupation, the need for YMSYL is not as important. The cool thing is you can still play with it in the deck for added direct damage once you set up. The easiest way to set up Walker Garrison quickly is by starting the 3rd Marker, 6th Marker (Mountains), then pull the docking bay with either IAO Combo or Ket Maliss (V3). If Veers (V10) is set up on a different site from the Mountains, each non-unique 2-player AT-AT would deploy for 2 each to the Mountains. The best set up would be to have General Veers (V4) on Blizzard 2 (V4) at the docking bay. Then you get a non-unique AT-AT to each of the other sites. You protect all the sites with Outflank (V9), which is better than Barrier. The reason you want Veers at the docking bay over the 3rd Marker is because you have to keep the ground battleground going for Occupation, plus if they play Optimism (V11), it doesn't take away the larger drain. If you don't want to play with Imperials, the other option for Hoth CR (V8) is a deck built around Whipids. This deck was better then Jabba the Hutt (V8) doubled all aliens and not just one. Whipids are power +2 when on Hoth and forfeit +2 from J'Quille (V8). This deck can be found under my Decktech page but its not the same deck without Jabba.\\par \\par How It Can Win: The best option for this deck is Walkers. It can win because it has so many different ways to cause damage. Besides the drains from Walker Garrison, you have 2 to 4 in direct damage from Rebel Base Occupation (depending on how many battlegrounds you have), and 3 to 5 in direct damage from YMSYL. From there you can play Frostbite with Sunsdown to cause more direct damage. Some tricks with this deck come from two cards that you never see being played. Exposure is a great card for Hoth CR (V8) because it can remove opponent's characters present at your exterior sites while you have 'Nighttime Conditions' going. You don't have to draw destiny, just use X Force, where X equals the total number of characters present (including your own, but yours should all be protected on Walkers). This happens during your Control phase, so you can clear out ALL the sites then hit them with a Walker Garrison. Another option is He Hasn't Come Back which can make any alone character at a Marker site missing if you draw destiny +3 > their ability. Not too hard to set up with Outflank (V9) being a Used 6 destiny Interrupt. Plus you always have Trample to abuse with ANY Walker based deck. This strategy is very basic when you think about it. Just like the Walker Objective, this deck plays the same way every game. Only you no longer have to worry about having to blow the shields. Even though you lose the 8 in direct damage from the shields getting blown away, just one drain from Walker Garrison can be just as bad, and there is NO limit to how many Garrisons you could play. If you work in some retrieval, then you would have the ability to play it every turn while you occupy the required sites with AT-ATs. The space for this type of deck can be very very basic. The DS can use Maul + Cloaking Ship to keep presence in space all game to drain for free. Unless the LS plays starships weapons and SATM Combo, they will not be able to ever knock Maul out of space. Your whole deck can be entirely ground based. Then you play 2x Tat Maul and 2x Ship. If you want Maul set up really fast, you can play 3x of each, and start Combat Response. The impact of virtual set 13 with the new AT-AT: Deployment Platform (V13) is not known yet. The complete immunity to attrition this site adds to non-unique At-Ats seems like it is made to be fit into this deck.\\par \\par What Change Since 1st Edition: Even though Hoth CR (V8) wasn't posted in the 1st Edition of this document, this deck did change greatly from its original design. As mentioned earlier, you could play two very different types of decks based on Hoth with CR (V8). The Redux and Re Edit changed so many different cards that both decks are completely different now. While most of the changes were good for the game, I don't see anything broken about being able to start the Ice Plains with the system and another site. It did make sense to limit how much activation and Effects could be started but there was nothing broken about this Hoth deck. You were even limited to just two Effects when you were starting the Ice Plains and Mountains together. This deck was getting to be pretty good before it was completely taken away. In my own opinion, I believe the original CR (V8) had more options for design. It was broken getting to start 4 Effects and being able to set up huge activation to start the game, but there was no limit to the combination of locations. Now you always have to start a battleground site in order to play this card. I don't believe the card had to be designed this way. This deck had just become a decent option for DS with Endor Shield (V11). Now we will never know.\\par \\par Why I SHOULD Play It: Even though there is some strategies that can be based around Hoth CR (V8), no one has been brave enough to post a deck around it. There are clearly some good possibilities but they stay hidden to the masses. For surprise factor alone, this deck could be a very good option for DS. It would be possible to set up very quickly. You would only have to worry about the Main Power Generators when playing against Speeders or EBO, and the majority of games you will have the advantage on Hoth. With any Hoth based deck, the LS could face any number of problems. Besides the already mentioned Sunsdown, going missing, and direct damage, the DS also has Wampas with Krayt Dragon Bones (V4). The virtual Wampa (V4) is ferocity 5 + destiny with KDB. Then they get another +2 if One Arm (V4) is also on table. Considering the highest power character for LS is Chewie Enraged at power 9, you have a good chance of eating just about any character you want. Even Mace (V9) and Qui-Gon can be eaten since you would already be one higher than their printed power before you ever drew destiny. Creatures may take a hit because of the new Advanced Rules on creatures but the impact of the new creature rules remains to be seen. Sando Aqua Monster is a great card for this deck because you can set up destinies for anything that can't be canceled. Until someone decides to start playing with this strategy, no one will ever know how amazing a DS deck based around CR (V8) could be.\\par \\par Why NOT to Play It: Yet another DS strategy that is unproven. So many players these days only play decks with a proven track record, decks that have been tested and designed by someone else. They use decks that have been taken to a few events and posted on Decktech. Just because this deck is a new idea doesn't mean it can't win. It just means the players as a whole have little experience against it. This is one of those decks that should be played by those who know how to play it. If you want a deck that is already proven, then stay away from this one. Make sure you playtest any new idea before taking it to a major tournament. This decks main weakness is space since the main version only places with Maul like the ISB drop and drain deck. Should you come up against a fast Hidden Base or EBO, you will have a hard game. Unlike regular Walkers, this deck can usually beat Hidden Base because you can easily get two full turns of Walker Garrison in before they have even flipped. Plus you are playing multiples of Maul + Ship, so you should be able to stay alive in space long enough to finish them off. If you fear EBO, make sure to pack at least one purple Epic Event card to blow the shields and at least one AT-AT Cannon (V4). If you can't blow the shields, you will not be able to handle the large EBO drains. Remember to do your best to never leave a random non-unique AT-AT alone without either a Ghhhk or Outflank (V9). Mechanical Failure can mean auto loss if you get caught sleeping. Other than that, there is just no out right bad match-up for this deck. Hopefully there will be someone out there who gives this deck a try.\\par \\par -----\\par \\par Naboo w/ Combat Readiness (V8)\\par \\par Starting Locations: Naboo: Theed Core (Starting Location), Naboo system, Naboo: Theed Palace Hallway or Swamp\\par \\par Popular Cards to Look For: Maul with Stick or Maul YA, Blaster Rack (V1), Force Field, Ket Maliss (V3), Battle Plains, AAT Tanks, Battle Droids\\par \\par Idea Behind Design: Naboo CR (V8) is another deck that no one has really seen before. This deck is an incomplete idea that I have been playing around with over the past year. The cool thing is even after the Re Edit, this deck can still be set up the same way it was before only losing the 4th Effect to start the game. There has not been a DS Naboo deck with CR (V8) that was posted to Decktech. The idea for this deck came from wanting to find a way to use Maul Young Apprentice in a deck besides the Bespin CR (V8) Vane (V6) deck. The original version started the game with Security Precautions (V4), so you activated 9 all by yourself just like the Bespin deck. After the Re Edit, SP (V4) now requires you to occupy the site in order for the Effect to stay in play. Since you can still start the same locations with the post Re Edit CR (V8), the deck requires you to start Crossfire (V9) to pull the SP (V4). The basic strategy for the deck is simple. Set up Maul YA with Double-bladed stick at the Core. Just like the LS, you can send any character with ability <5 to used pile when 'hit'. Since Maul gets two swings, it can be very easy to knock any LS character off the site. The reason you want Maul YA is because he adds +1 to each swing when targeting a Jedi. Any 'hit' Jedi Master then become power -3. So if Mace (V9) or Qui-Gon come calling, you not only make them forfeit 0 but power 3. You can easily set up overflow with Crossfire (V9) and Maul Strikes adding battle destinies. Since you are playing Maul's Double stick, you can drain for +2. Once you set up at the system, you can set up the Admiral's Order Fighter Cover, which adds another +1 to each of your weapons destinies at related sites from system you occupy. Since you lost the 4th starting Effect, your start can be Blaster Rack (V1), Combat Response, and either Crossfire (V9) for pulling SP (V4) OR you could play Ket Maliss (V3) to pull Dannik Jerriko. The original version would start all 4, and tried to place the lost characters out of play. The main reason to play Ket Maliss (V3) is because you can pull cheap deploy characters to protect Maul at the Core. Since Maul YA is immune to Clash of Sabers, the LS can never battle the Core without Maul being involved unless they can hit him first and play SATM Combo. By adding scrubs to Maul's site, you add forfeit for any attrition and a waste of swing should the LS target one of them since they just go back in Used pile. Then you just re-pull them next turn. Dannik Jerriko (non-V) can be a great edition. This card lets you put any just lost character in battle at same site out of play for just 1 Force. The character goes underneath Dannik, so if he is killed or placed in Used pile, he loses those characters, but they stay out of play. The (V3) version of him lets you place ANY card from opponents lost pile out of play for 1 Force but you have to win the battle. The (non-V) doesn't require you to win the battle. So the LS has a choice, go after Maul with a weapon or Jerriko.\\par \\par How It Can Win: Naboo CR (V8) can win because it can set up very fast with the starting activation of 7. It is very easy to set up the ground first turn with Maul and then space with a matching ship second turn. You spend the rest of the game defending the two locations while you drain for 6+ all game. Fighter Cover also makes your starfighers power +3 when armed with a weapon. Since Maul holds the Core, the best option for space is Baron Soontir Fel on Saber 1 with a SFS Laser Cannon. In the previous version I played, the deck played Mist Hunter (V5) and Slave I (V7). This deck used Boba Fett (non-V) from Cloud City because he adds +2 to maneuver. The ship adds +2 to manuever, so he is a base manuever of 8. The deck played 2 to 3 Short Range Combos to set up space fast. Since he can deploy for free as a 'react', it was nice surprising the attacking LS with an addition 7 power, +8 in destiny that can't be canceled or modified since it wasn't drawn from Reserve. At the time, this deck had problems with the Endor Mains deck playing the 'Back Door' Effects. Since there is no more Endor Mains deck, there is a good chance this deck could be an excellent option for DS. Just like the LS Naboo deck, the Core with loaded Maul is almost impossible to defeat. Most players find this out the hard way since they always think they can go after Maul. Once you have the AO set up, you only need to draw two 2s to hit Mace. Once Bane Malar (V7) is in place, there is no way the LS can do anything to the Core drain besides reducing the drain to 1 with Let's Keep A Little Optimism Here(V11). The deck must play SAC to keep Optimism (V11) away from Maul.\\par \\par What Changed Since 1st Edition: Besides the 4th Effect and change to SP (V4), this deck didn't change at all. The entire strategy that was there from the beginning still exists. As mentioned above, this deck is going to be very new to many of you reading it right now. If you don't want to worry about the Ket Maliss (V3) stuff, you can try another option for this deck. Since you are able to start the Theed Palace Hallway, you can once per game deploy any battle droid. There are many that can help this deck. There are two unique battle droids add +4 to the deploy cost of either Jedi or Smugglers. Another battle droid can reduce forfeit value and another allows you to place ANY card from opponent's Reserve deck out of play by losing 2 Force if you just verified the deck. For this text to work the droid has to be present with another battle droid. If you get just one in your opening hand, you can easily set up two droids by pulling the one you need from the Hallway text. Since you are playing with droids, you can play Droid Shutdown to protect them from being targeted by anything that turn. The Hallway is Force drain -1 for LS, so it makes the best option for your third starting site. The original CR (V8) gave you more options. For those that don't believe in the Core idea, the other option for DS with Naboo CR (V8) is building a deck around the AAT Tanks. Endor Shield (V11) can pull the Commander battle droids, so you can easily set up the AAT Tanks with the required pilots. The idea behind this deck is the same as the Core version only you start the Battle Plains instead. You still give up 5 icons and lose one yourself, but you gain the broken power of the tanks. While Tanks can be played in many different platforms, the Battle Plains is the best possible option since they are each power +2. While the Core text is very powerful, once you set up two AAT Tanks at one site, there is no way the LS is coming after you without help from Savrip or Quick Draw (V9).\\par \\par Why I SHOULD Play It: The main reason to play this deck is because it is totally new. No one will be expecting this deck at a local tournament. Since you activate so much Force so early, you can easily set up very fast and start dealing out damage. Since Maul is your main option for ground, the rest of the deck can be just about anything. If you don't want to use matching ships, you can also play Motti (V2) and Star Destroyers. Motti (V2) says each Destroyers is power +5 if armed with a weapon. If you use Heavy Turbolaser Batteries, you get another +2 to power. So each Destroyers is power +7. If you set up power 20+ at any system, the LS is going to leave you alone. This gives you a solid hold of both the system and Core for Battle Plan and Firepower (V6). Once the LS figures out they can't handle you at either location, they will have to try their own strategy in order to win. This can be a great match-up for TRMs since you are never choked on Force and already have an advantage by the LS having to come to your locations in order to win. The deck can play Stunning Leader, Imperial Barriers, Force Fields, You Are Beaten, etc to keep the LS on the defensive all game. While this deck is not being played right now, it can be a very solid and different choice for DS.\\par \\par Why NOT to Play It: The biggest reason to not play this deck is the start. Just like the LS Naboo deck, this one gives up a lot of icons to the LS to start the game. While the LS gives up 4 icons, the DS gives up 5!!!! Of course there are many DS decks that have given up that many icons to the LS after their first turn of play. So it isn't that big of a deal unless you are playing against TRMs. Even though you can beat TRMs, they will get the first turn, so depending on their deck, they can easily deploy to your Core first turn. Once you are set up though, it will not be easy for any LS deck to defeat you at the Core. The whole deck is built around the Core and space. The other reason not to play this deck is the fact that it is a new idea. This is not the best option for a player looking for a proven strategy to play at a major tournament. Whether you use the Core or Plains, both versions are up in the air. While I have had very good success around this strategy, there is not much else I can add about its ability to win in the current environment. For the time being feel free to try out the aspects of this deck with friends and wait until you feel comfortable playing it.\\par \\par -----\\par \\par Endor w/ Combat Readiness (V8)\\par \\par Starting Locations: Endor: Any Battleground site (Starting Location), Endor system, another 1 icon Endor site.\\par \\par Popular Cards to Look For: Mains, AT-STs, Scouts, Bikers, Aratech Corporation (V9), Back Door, Bunker\\par \\par Idea Behind Design: Endor CR (V8) is another DS strategy that is not all that popular. While there were a few versions that were played when CR (V8) was first released, the popularity of Endor with CR (V8) is all but gone. The main reason for this is the LS constantly playing Strike Planning to take way the activation from the Endor system. The Re Edit took away the ability to start two 2 icon sites for DS. Now you have to start either the Endor: docking bay, bunker, or non-unique Forest. If you happen to play against a LS deck that starts Strike Planning, your starting activation goes from 5 to just 3. The lack of activation in the current environment makes this deck very unpopular. With the game constantly changing and more deck types being created all the time, DS players are choosing to play other options that can set up faster and keep steady activation all game. Endor CR (V8) just doesn't do this as well anymore. There are some interesting aspects around Endor for DS, the more powerful strategies are based around Tatooine, Hoth, or Bespin. If the DS does choose to set up around Endor, it will usually always be with the Endor Ops Objective since it gets around Strike Planning and does more to set up a strategy on Endor. The most you can do is play with AT-STs or Biker Scouts at multiple sites since they can React. The virtual cards that help Endor based decks don't really do much for a basic CR (V8) deck. The majority help the Objective.\\par \\par How It Can Win: This is one of those DS decks that I am not as confident about since there is nothing special going on with it. If there was going to be a deck built around it, the best option would be a mains & toys platform with EPPs, SAC, fun red cards, and AT-ATs to set up and drain on Endor. There are three sites on Endor that can drain for 2 each; Back Door, Dark Forest, and Forest Clearing. The original CR (V8) would start two of them. This deck played A Dark Time For The Rebellion (V4) and used both the Hoth: Wampa Cave and the Dagobah: Cave for additional activation. The strategy was based around a DS TRMs style by reacting to the LS strategy and attempting to disrupte it. At the time, it did pretty well since the CR (V8) idea was still new. A few versions were even posted on Decktech. When the original Scum deck was created, the majority turned to DS aliens leaving the idea around Endor forgotten. Today, this is not being played as a DS option. While I normally have some excellent strategy for each deck, this one is lacking. In time, there should be more ideas that come out of this type of deck. Maybe if a virtual card that can prevent Strike Planning from cancelling your icons, then this deck would open up more.\\par \\par What Changed Since 1st Edition: This is yet another deck that really didn't exist during the 1st Edition of this document. There was no real strategy section for this deck in the last Edition, so there is nothing to write as far as it changing. If anything, the deck got Endor Shield (V11) to pull stuff and set up that much faster. Endor Shield (V11) is one of those cards that would be in 99% of all Endor CR (V8) based decks.\\par \\par Why I SHOULD Play It: This is currently one of those decks you should be staying away from. There are a few ideas that can be used to at least make the deck viable to win games. One idea would be to use Location, Location, Location (V5) to pull all the non-unique Forests. Then you set up Emperor with Overseeing It Personally to drain +1 at each site you have an Imperial present. If you put a Scout at each Forest, they can move, while the majority of LS characters would require +1 landspeed. Outflank (V9) can be used very well in this deck to protect the characters spread out at each site. The majority of decks are going to be ground based. Regular Endor CR (V8) would not usually be the best option for a DS space based deck unless you would trying to hold the battleground site to drain for free. With all the different aspects to the game, ALL the other planets currently have more going for them. Tatooine, Hoth, and Bespin can all win more constantly over any deck based around Endor. Even the Endor Operations Objective is not as proven as the other platforms. Until new options arise, it would be wise to look at one of the other DS decks listed here.\\par \\par Why NOT to Play It: Endor provides the DS with Scouts and another place to use Walkers. The problem is there just aren't any really powerful red cards that can benefit the DS at Endor versus another planet. Endor has no Occupation card for direct damage. No Decree for getting around drains. No Ice Storm or Sandwhirl for making characters missing. All DS alien based deck happen around other planets. If you do go with Endor, it is all Imperial based. Imperial Domination (V4) makes sense with this deck type. For the time being keep your eye out for any new ideas for playing this deck. It will stay un-played while the potential of your opponent playing with Strike Planning is high and your activation remains at just 3 total from your three locations.",

When facing Imperial Justice (V), the immunity reduction is good because otherwise it could be problematic cracking Lord Vader's immunity < 6. Also, since you are battling you can count on making your opponent lose lots of Dark Jedi as well as lots of battles, so the additional Force loss is important.

This works well w/ #1 as well, since you can't fire with your EPPs. The attrition reduction is a two-edged sword; so make sure you have some fodder. I can't tell you how many times it has turned a weak destiny draw into a site clearer.

The light side version made my list, but for dark side I just think there's far better battling helpers available. The strength of most of the powerful light side decks is EPP hit-and-run. I really only see the dark side version of this card being useful if you keep it on the table for a turn, so your opponent loses a Force from their EPP strike, or if you are going against an immunity-mains deck like Profit, which is unpopular at best, or the Careful Planning (V) Endor deck, which this card would work quite well against.",

    "Information": "Articel on DeckTech, October 31st, 2005\\par Top 5 Damage-Controlling V-Cards (Light Side) by Armaedes and Shewski\\par \\par The first time you play this card, it reduces any control phase damage, including a Force drain at a battleground. After that, the damage it works on minimizes but it's still an effective counter to direct damage sources like Occupations or You May Start Your Landing. Especially due to the popularity of the Combat Readiness (V) Scum deck, the ability to reduce Occupation damage is huge. Think about it - Occupation and YMSYL rarely does more than 3-4 points of damage tops. If you get two copies of Imperial Atrocity (V) out at the same time, you can reduce this damage down to 1 point a turn and almost completely neuter the effectiveness of the damaging card. To top it all off, this card is destiny-6 so it won't hurt you to play multiples of it, and it can be pulled with Don't Do That Again, so you can always have it when you need it.\\par \\par SHEWSKI'S TAKE:\\par These cards are definitely strong. If using that card, you can use Occupation cancellers to help keep your damage down. One card you can use it with is Honor of the Jedi. Personally, I prefer Honor for its universal reduction but if you are worried about a lot of No Escape being played this isn't too bad, either.\\par Armaedes' had the LS version of this card ranked in the last article, and I agree with its inclusion. It probably belongs more on the LS list than over here, but my DS needed some fleshing out so I cheated a little. Simply put, a lot of direct damage happens in the control phase, and this card tempers it. I feel the LS version is stronger since there is simply more direct damage that you are likely to face. LS direct damage, as mentioned above, is on a low ebb. Regardless of side, the card is very playable and reliable with its status as an Immediate Effect. Even if you aren't playing a damaging deck, you can still reduce a drain by 2 (even at a battleground), which at times is extremely handy, especially since the card keeps giving back to you. As always, high destinies are always welcome in any deck, and this card easily fits the bill. Watch out for Control- this card isn't immune to it. One fun way to use this card is in conjunction with the non-V version. You can use a variety of means to deploy a handful of copies of the easy to deploy V version, and then wait for your chance to play the old school version and cause a bunch of Force loss. It's hard to pull off, but can be as deadly as a beatdown.\\par \\par ARMAEDES' TAKE:\\par Shewski's always coming through with the tech, combining this with the non-V version. This is a really great card, and high-destiny to boot.",

This problem just got a whole lot simpler for the dark side.\\par \\par (V) Xizor allows you to take an unexpected interruption into hand from reserve deck once per turn. Unexpected interruption was also virtualized and has it's own nice little effect but I like the non-virtualized version of this card much better.\\par The non-virtual text says that you may use 2 force to pull any interrupt from your reserve deck. That opens so many doors and gives you so many new options to chose from. This allows you to run fewer cards in your deck designed to get you things such as interrupts that allow you to pull characters, weapons, effects, etc. I've used this to pull things such as trooper assault and dark jedi presence in trooper decks, destiny adders in beat down decks, and my personal favorite of pulling Twi'lek advisor. Maybe there's one effect that you need in the first few turns but you can't get it out because you can't get a Twi'lek, well now you can.\\par \\par At this point you're probably thinking how am I supposed to get Xizor out first turn to set this up? This is not really a big problem except that you can only do it on Tatooine.\\par This combo is only going to work with a few decks such as Agents of the black sun, No money no parts no deal, Hunt down, My kind of scum, and Carbon freezing. Start Location, Location, Location (V) and Ket Malis (V). Pull a tatooine docking bay with Ket and pull Tatooine: Jabbas Palace with LLL (V). Use the Jabbas Palace text to pull the Audience Chamber, pull Xizor as your one alien with the Audience Chamber text and use Xizor to get Unexpected Interruption which will give you any Interrupt you want.\\par \\par You can also start Jabbas Influence (V) and pull Jabba with the Audience Chamber and use Jabba to pull Xizor. I like to use this with hunt down because what hunt down needs is to get out sites for force activation start mob points as your third starting effect and you could activate 11 force on your own by the second turn and still be able to get out blaster rack (V) to pull your character weapons by using the Xizor combo. I will run only one Twi'lek in a deck and three unexpected interruptions that allow me to pull whatever interrupt the situation calls for. Like I said this combo gives you options by allowing you to pull the one copy of any interrupt that you throw in your deck as a precaution that will really screw over someone else's deck. I warn you though that this combo is not designed to be the bases of a whole deck, it is designed to give you complete control of the options given to you with a well balanced drain/beatdown deck such as hunt down and the watto deck. This combo will work every time but it is up to you to use the advantage it gives you wisely. As always go out and have fun seeing what this combo can improve in your game. May the force be with you.",

First of all, it makes those immunity mains with weapons much stronger as they will always have access to their weapon, since Sai'torr (V) can get it out and Quick Draw (V) sends it to the Used Pile if it's lost. The other reason this helps battling decks is that it allows light mains decks to target vehicles, which have been a safe haven from light side weapons for a long time. Now dark vehicles aren't safe from lightsaber-toting mains. As an added benefit, your lightsabers get a destiny bonus as well.\\par \\par SHEWSKI'S TAKE:\\par An added benefit??

First of all, playing this card with a flipped objective gives you a guaranteed battle destiny in every battle. This alone can be considered a damage reducer as it makes it that much harder for your opponent to do a beat down. Then, once they do get their less-than-effective beatdown pulled off, you can ignore 7 battle damage from it. So you get your character's power, a battle destiny, possibly your characters forfeit, and then add 7 to that total, and that's how much damage a lone character can handle before a beatdown is going to hurt you. Obviously, the down side of this card is that you can't play it in every deck since it will only work with alien decks like Agents In The Court and Quiet Mining Colony (and certain builds of Watch Your Step). However, when it comes to finding cards that reduce damage it's hard to pass over a card that says \"ignore battle damage\" in it.\\par \\par SHEWSKI'S TAKE:\\par Bah! I consider this (and WYS (V)) bad examples of how to create damage controllers. A lot of NPEs came from both of those, but I can't deny its strength - as most recently evidenced at Worlds when AITC ran amok. This is a very, very strong damage reducer that thankfully got errata'ed to remove the Bo Shuda loophole, but I could justify having this not rank in my top 5 since I found other candidates that are more universal or better for the game.",

    "Information": "Article on DeckTech, August 19th, 2007 '2nd Annual SWCCG Encyclopedia of Decks' by Brandon \"Jabba_the_Ruck\" Ruck\\par http://www.decktech.net/starwarsccg/articles/articles.php?id=6526&view=2\\par \\par Popular Cards to Look For: Dash or a Han to start with Outrider or Falcon, No Questions Asked (V8), Corellians\\par \\par Idea Behind Objective: This virtual objective had the BIGGEST change from any other since the first post of this article, so much so that this entire entry had to be completely redone. WYS (V8) is still the newest of all the objectives to hit the game. This LS objective turned out to have more problems than either previous virtual objectives made by the PC. The original idea had to be scrapped and completely recreated to the objective described here. The new version is so weak now that it has become a deck that I personally have very little strategy for. Right now, you still get the start of the game with a solid LS ship, either Outrider or Falcon. From there, you have to control two Corellia sites with Corellians in order to flip. The original version of the objective allowed you to flip with any character. Now you start the game with the Corellia <> spaceport site, so the DS can immediately invade the planet on their first turn. Since you have to control two sites with Corellians in order to flip, the deck is MUCH harder to flip fast. The new version requires you to build the deck with a way to deploy two sites in one turn and get out two Corellians to each site. Since there is no way to pull two Corellians in one turn easily, the deck is almost impossible to flip when the DS invades your starting site first turn. That means you have to get a ship to Corellia and land the Outrider/Falcon to flip. The strongest part of the original WYS (V8) was the +3 to deployment of cards to Corellia and that is gone. The DS can easily afford the force to beatdown the very weak Corellians that are being used to flip the objective.\\par \\par How It Can Win: Right now, this is the WORST LS objective in the game. The seven side does NOTHING for the LS to make it worth playing. It has no way to cause damage outside of draining. No form of retrieval or text that hurts the DS in anyway WHAT-SO-EVER. Even DBO makes the DS Force drains -1. The original WYS (V8) was so overly broken that the PC got scared when designing this new version. They didn't really think of anything worthwhile for the objective to do besides getting to draw the bottom card of your Reserve deck at the end of each turn. Since you have to put cards in used pile any time you deploy a card with ability that isn't a Corellian, you are really just getting back the card you had to put back to begin with. The only thing the deck has going for it at all is No Questioned Asked (V8) providing Force drain +1 at Corellia sites. This used to be awesome with Speeders since they were protected by the deploy +3 and you could use T-47 Battle Formation to get drains of 3 at each site. Now the objective prevents you from even wanting to put Combat Vehicles in the deck.\\par \\par What Changed Since 1st Edition: Funny, this was listed as the strongest LS objective at the time of the original version of this article. Now it is the weakest. This section doesn't mean much here since the entire objective changed. Right now it seems fairly certain that no one will ever play and win with this objective unless they build the deck to NOT flip and make it work as a space deck off of the starting ship. You can't even pull Kessel with it anymore. So everything you would use to win has nothing to do with the objective past the starting cards. I personally consider this to be the BIGGEST waste of a Virtual card. What is the point of Ving a card that is as bad as any card in the game??? The seven side uses half the printed space to list out text that hurts the LS, then uses the rest to pull the weakest characters to play with like BoShek. You can't pull No Questions Asked (V8), Kessel, or Corran Horn, all parts of the original that could have stayed with this new version. Nothing about pulling any of those cards makes this deck that strong, so where'd they go??\\par \\par Why I SHOULD Play It: The absolute only reason to play this deck is as a space based deck that doesn't flip. You do have the Outrider or Falcon already in play to start the game. When you add Strike Planning to pull either General Solo or General Calrissian, the ship becomes a solid presence in space. From there you could pull General Rieekan (V4) to pull Romas (V4), who then pulls all your systems. If you add support cards for space like any Hidden Base deck, this could be another viable LS space option. Your options for the ground would need to build the deck around another planet if you plan to avoid getting a huge beatdown. You could start Uh-Oh (V7) and set up the <> Desert on Corellia with a Kitnok for a drain of 2. Put a Sandwhirl there, and you have the same battleground as Hidden Base. Since you start with the spaceport site, you could put CZ-3 there providing you a reacting Sandwhirl at the adjacent Desert should the first one get canceled by Control. This is still not a great idea but you at least have some options with a different strategy.\\par \\par Why NOT to Play It: If you can't see the reasons not to play this objective by now, you didn't read the earlier sections. This objective can in no way give you enough power over the DS to be worth playing. As stated previously, the seven side doesn't give you ANY bonus ability over the DS. When you think about the game and ALL the previous objectives listed, each one provides the LS with SOME advantage; Pay 1 to Draw 1, DS Force drains -1, Canceling drains, retrieval, immunity to attrition, added battle or power destiny, game ending duel, add to destiny number, direct damage, SOMETHING! Not this one. The only way this deck will become tournament viable is if someone figures out a way to use the drawing of cards from the bottom of Reserve or if new V cards are made to help the objective. The thought of that in itself is funny since the objective itself is a V card.",
