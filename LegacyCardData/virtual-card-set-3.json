I really enjoyed V8 for all the new possibilities that it brought to LS battling, and this is one of them. It is a new twist on the \"Fab Four\" Effects that can fit into a variety of decks. The deployment choices are nice, but it is stronger going on the Back Door. Immediately you get some extra card advantage. Universally your EPPs and other scrub Rebels get stronger, and your opponents have some trouble deploying to your stronghold (especially nice if deployed on Han). The best thing about this text is the ungrabbable Blaster Deflection. Lots of bad things can happen to your hit characters, so don't let it happen. General Solo can pull this every turn for optimal abuse. You can even cancel your own targeting if you want to cycle this for more cards on the following turn.\\par \\par ARMAEDES' TAKE:\\par Aargh! I can't believe I forgot this one! Although I think of this less as a battling card and more of a defensive card. In a battling deck these days, you rarely want your characters to stay on the table for long because they'll run the risk of a return beating. Really this card is about keeping your guys alive, not beating down your opponent's guys. Still a solid card, but not what I would consider a \"typical\" battle aid.",

J'Quille (V)\\par J'Quille (V) is a great battle-aiding card because you can get characters to any non-Dagobah location in the game with him. Unless your opponent is playing Dagobah locations (where they can't do any damage anyway), they can't put a character anywhere and be safe. If all J'Quille (V) did was get you to any location you wanted to go to, it would still be an incredible card. But he also gives you some more pro-battling gametext with the Force loss clause of his gametext. This helps battling decks because it makes your opponent more wary of stacking a whole lot of characters at one location and preventing you from battling without getting wiped out. Essentially, J'Quille (V) makes your opponent spread their Force more thinly to avoid massive Force loss, and spreading thin plays right into the hands of a solid battling deck.\\par \\par SHEWSKI'S TAKE:\\par \\par I'm torn on him. Sure, it's nice to have him as a staging area into fortified area, but I think he (and Tanus for the LS) did some bad things as well. A pullable beatdown spy for Scum isn't so hot. I also wish that the Force loss was contingent on initiating a battle at his location instead of just deployment. Some hit and run tactics can evolve from that. Finally, while at the time Speeders raised its ugly head, he was a big fat blunt object that really kicked that deck to the curb. He could probably have done enough damage on his own or if gave DS a way to drop the Hoth Shield - kinda like what a saboteur might do.

With the number of ways dark side has to pull aliens from the deck, and with Jabba (V) doubling the power of almost all of them, you can create devastating beatdowns in record time.

He can react to a Force drain to block it, then be placed in Used Pile to block a second drain at a related location. The only downside to this is that some opponents will stop draining after Grond (V)'s react so that they can beat him down instead of allowing you to put him in the Used Pile. Just make sure you always have a \"bail me out\" card in hand just in case, so that if your opponent catches onto your tactic you can save yourself a beating, then stop reacting and just put Grond (V) in the Used Pile to cancel a single drain.\\par \\par SHEWSKI'S TAKE:\\par \\par Nice idea!

This one is nice but in my mind not as strong as IWWTF. First off, it�s a little more limited on its deployment since Chewie is generally not as useful as Han. Secondly, it doesn't have the loop potential that IWWTF has. But it is still hard to deny the effectiveness of the Effect. Extra activation is always nice, but it is a mandatory activation- be sure to factor that into any tracking plans of yours. The universal battle destiny bonus is very helpful as is the battle canceling text. Use that if you get into a pinch and then cut into the odds with a well timed Sorry About the Mess. The most exciting bit of text on this card is the relocation part at the end. You can use it defensively to get out of the way of a beat. You can use it offensively to jump into a battle. You can also use it to get to an empty site, which ostensibly helps RST but also can get you an extra Force drain. The possibilities are endless!\\par \\par ARMAEDES' TAKE:\\par I find it hard to consider a card that has \"cancel a battle\" in its gametext to be a good battle-aiding card, but the rest of the text is undeniably battle-oriented. Adding 1 to battle destiny draws is huge, and at worst will offset Lando Calrissian (V) trying to reduce your battle destiny. The \"Path Of Least Resistance\" text is also great for warping one of your big guns into a battle, especially in an Endor deck where you're playing a number of related locations. The deployment restrictions of this card keep it from making my own list, but in the right deck this can really cause your opponent some unexpected pain.",
