The only other things you need are Closers, and those have a destiny of 6, and they are used. Rycar's run also only takes 2 turns to pull off, if you use a Closer each turn. Also, you get 8 Force (assuming all asteroid sectors are present, which shouldn't be a problem in an Asteroid Sanctuary deck) for just losing 1 card and using others that you would be using regardless. No destiny draws, you know what you are getting, and it sets you up for another 'Run. You can't lose it by having your target/ship killed with an Interrupt like Gravity Shadow with Kessel Run, or Look Sir, Droids with Death Star Plans.\\par \\par The problem arises with that one turn where your ship gets stranded out at the Big One. This is easily conquered with Cap'n Han on the Falcon with R2-D2, Chewie, and maybe even some Special Mods. Or even R2-D2 and Luke on Red 5. This pretty much makes your ship tough to get with battles, and nearly impossible (watch out for DS asteroid decks) to kill with Asteroids, ensuring that the 'Run goes through. So, what Rycar's Run actually does for your Asteroid Sancuary Deck is to make you last longer against ground-drain decks without incorporating unreliable undercover spies. I would recommend putting about 4 of them in a Sancuary deck, along with 6 Closers. ",
