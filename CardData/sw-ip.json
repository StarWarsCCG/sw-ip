Also, players must use the positive root (thus, the square root of 4 is 2, not -2).\\par Brainiac's destiny and power should not be rounded. If you're comparing this number to a certain value, examine it to see if it meets the requirements. For example, if Alter targets Luke Skywalker and Brainiac is drawn, Alter succeeds (because p is less than 4), and if All Wings Report In targets your three YWings, it also succeeds (p is greater than 3). If Brainiac is drawn for battle destiny and a player must satisfy p attrition, that player must forfeit at least p points of forfeit value (usually meaning 4 must be forfeited). However, you must round whenever you are required to do something which is impossible in partial amounts (e.g., you cannot retrieve, activate, or lose an irrational amount of Force, you cannot cause an irrational number of characters to be lost, etc.). For example, Vader initiates a duel against Luke using Vader's Obsession (\"Each adds two destiny to power. Winner retrieves lost Force equal to the difference. Loser loses same amount of Force, plus the character.\"), and one of Luke's destinies is Brainiac. Vader's total is 14 and Luke's is 14.14159..., which means that Luke wins and retrieves Force equal to the difference (0.14159...). Because that's impossible, Light retrieves 0. Dark loses the same amount, also rounding to 0, and Vader, because even though no Force was lost or retrieved, Luke's total was still higher.",

Similarly, if cards are removed from the location during the resolution (such as by a Program Trap), they will still contribute power and still add a destiny draw for purposes of resolving the Counter Assault. This Interrupt does not cause a battle and thus cards may not be forfeited to reduce Force loss. Remember that, at a system location, characters and vehicles aboard starships are not present at the system. Therefore, for Counter Assault there will ordinarily only be one destiny draw per starship at the system but none for any cards aboard. Counter Assault may technically be played at a holosite but, since there are no characters present (only dejariks and holograms), no destiny will be drawn and zero will be compared to the opponent's total power.",

When facing Imperial Justice (V), the immunity reduction is good because otherwise it could be problematic cracking Lord Vader's immunity < 6. Also, since you are battling you can count on making your opponent lose lots of Dark Jedi as well as lots of battles, so the additional Force loss is important. Furthermore, the card is destiny-6 and easily cycles back into your Reserve Deck for easy tracking. If you generate enough Force - and every mains deck should have solid generation - it will be an easy thing to pay the 3 Force \"upkeep\" cost if you should need to.\\par \\par SHEWSKI'S TAKE:\\par ADLR is #2 on my DS listing, and I have to take exception with DWTE being better than it. These cards aren't meant to stay on the table- this card is wonderful to cycle through your deck for destiny of whatnot. The upkeep is manageable, but I can't think of any time I've used this card and kept it on the table by paying for it.\\par -----\\par Article at DeckTech, September 19th, 2005\\par Top 5 Battle-Aiding V-Cards (Dark Side) by Armaedes and Shewski\\par \\par Deploy on table. All immunity to attrition is reduced by 3. You may not fire permanent weapons. Whenever a Jedi is lost, or opponent loses a battle, opponent loses 1 Force. During your draw phase, lose 1 Force or place this card in your Used Pile. (Immune to Alter.)\\par \\par Much like my #1 pick, I like the DS card a little more than the LS version. There are more Jedi that see play than Dark Jedi, and many have little immunity or none at all, which can mean guaranteed Force loss. This card is not meant to stay on the table, but cycle through your deck to show up as a big destiny draw or to deploy again for more Force loss. This works well w/ #1 as well, since you can't fire with your EPPs. The attrition reduction is a two-edged sword; so make sure you have some fodder. I can't tell you how many times it has turned a weak destiny draw into a site clearer. A great card that is fun to use along with other battle winning cards like Insignificant Rebellion.\\par \\par ARMAEDES' TAKE:\\par I agree completely with your assessment of the strengths of this card. The light side version made my list, but for dark side I just think there's far better battling helpers available. The strength of most of the powerful light side decks is EPP hit-and-run. I really only see the dark side version of this card being useful if you keep it on the table for a turn, so your opponent loses a Force from their EPP strike, or if you are going against an immunity-mains deck like Profit, which is unpopular at best, or the Careful Planning (V) Endor deck, which this card would work quite well against.",

Although this card appears more defensive in nature it can actually be a very powerful offensive card.\\par \\par SHEWSKI'S TAKE:\\par This ranks just outside my top 5 on both sides. CD/AAA have already conditioned you to getting more mileage out your immunity mains, this just reinforces that principle. I don't like this in the early game in case a key card gets trapped under the Effect, but mid-game onwards it is a welcome play. I think this will also give those decks that rely solely upon immunity mains (THGG, WHAP, Invasion) a little bump into playability. Remember, total battle destiny can still be affected!!\\par -----\\par This is the card old-school Star Wars CCG players have been waiting for since Reflections 3, a card that finally makes it to where your opponent can't use Boba Fett, Bounty Hunter, IG-88 With Riot Gun and 4-LOM With Concussion Rifle aboard Zuckuss In Mist Hunter to instantly end the game in a battle destiny-adding frenzy. Play this card - which you can start - and three battles per game you can limit both players to one battle destiny. Play two of this non-unique card and it's good for six battles per game, and few games have more than six battles (and not many have more than three).\\par \\par So besides limiting destiny-adding fetishes, what does this card really mean for light side? For one thing, it means light side immunity mains are back. Ben Kenobi being immune < 5 used to mean nothing when he was facing multiple draws. Now immune < 5 can only be cracked by a solid destiny draw. Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight armed with his saber is basically immune to attrition. Obi-Wan Kenobi (V) is even better.\\par \\par This card also works well in space. Playing I'll Take The Leader to give your Outrider immunity < 6 is huge now. The Millenium Falcon with the same Admiral's Order out is only going down to a draw of 7 or better. Home One is basically invincible.\\par \\par This card really brings SWCCG back to where it should be - when main characters are able to stay on the table for more than a turn or two, and your opponent really has to bring the beats to get rid of a big, bad main. Matching pilot starships are also a lot stronger now, and all of this is tempered by the fact that you can't play Bright Hope (V) and Tantive IV (V) and rule the sky by cancelling your opponent's only destiny draw. This is also a great card to use if you find yourself going against a destiny-cancelling team, as using this effect will prevent your destiny draw from being cancelled.\\par \\par This card is going to make a lot of light side decks viable again, as they won't have to worry about the Super-Fett beatdown as much. Dont' get goldenrody though - your opponent will still be able to brign a lot of power in your direction. Below is a deck that takes advantage of the newfound respect light mains are going to get due to this card. ",

It barely missed the cut because the second portion of the text requires that you control a site and a system to make it work, and hardcore battling decks rarely do this. The part of the card that makes the opponent lose Force can be good, but frankly if your opponent has a choice between taking a beating and losing a measley two cards (which, as you point out, is reduced by Honor Of The Jedi), they're going to lose the 2 no questions asked. In other words, those this is a card that should be played in every battling deck, it doesn't actually help your big battles happen because the opponent is still able to use their \"escape\" cards, they just have to lose a couple of Force to do so - which oftentimes is a fair trade.",

Solo's ability being a top level action and the nature of interrupts. For example, Whoooo! can be played by Han to take an N-1 starfighter into hand during a battle, but it can't be played to make Droid Starfighters power -1 because it would have to be played in response to a battle; likewise a card like The Signal has one part that can only be played at the start of the game, yet clearly is only in the deck to be used in its other aspect as a Used interrupt.

This means you can either try to overtake a racer who is slightly ahead of yours, or you can try to create a setback for a racer gaining on one of your own. Since race destiny is drawn during the Dark Side's Control Phase, the Dark Side player has the option of playing this card before or after race destinies are drawn, although playing Hit Racer first is wise, since you may eliminate your opponent's race destiny this turn.\\par \\par If you successfully damage your opponent's racer, you get the immediate benefit of causing the Light Side to skip a race destiny. But even better than that is the added game text. Until the target racer is repaired, the Light Side will have to lose 1 Force in order to use any race destiny. This will potentially cause them to gradually fall behind your racer as they make hard decisions about what race destinies to keep.\\par \\par This card is probably best used when you are within reach of winning the race. After all, since the Light Side will retrieve 6 Force for winning the race (and even more if they're playing with cards like I Did It!), he probably won't mind losing a couple of Force in order to use race destinies that will take him across the finish line first.\\par \\par Of course, your opponent will need to be playing Anakin's Podracer for this to work, since Hit Racer cannot be played on a generic podracer. But with the importance that racing is likely to have in the game, it shouldn't be surprising to see Anakin's Podracer showing up in many decks.",

There's really no easier way to reduce damage, as it requires no commitment from the Dark Side player other than that they commit a card slot to a destiny-6 Effect. If Vader's hanging around an adjacent site, this card will obviously become even more powerful. Simple Effect that can make a huge difference in a game.\\par \\par SHEWSKI'S TAKE:\\par \\par Wow, talk about an obvious miss on my part- great idea for a damage controller. The LS version (Projection of a Skywalker) was played quite a bit for similar reasons. The one thing that I don't like about this card is its fixed location. If you temper a drain at a planet where there are multiple sites, your opponent can always move around it.

In addition to offering some solid character retrieval, this card also does a decent job of causing your opponent to spread out quickly so that they can suspend the gametext of this card. The battle destiny limiting may seem like a bad idea for a battling deck, but in reality there aren't a lot of ways for all-Imperial decks to get multiple battle destiny anyway, and this way you can use characters like Lord Vader and have the immunity to attrition be worth more than if you had to worry about your opponent drawing 5 battle destiny and basically making your immunity worthless. Another reason this is a solid battling card is because if you draw battle or weapon destiny and accidentally flip a character, you can take it into hand and try again, allowing you to play with more characters than you would normally be able to get away with while still maintaining the integrity of the deck's destiny.\\par \\par SHEWSKI'S TAKE:\\par Wow, great minds think alike. This is my #5 as well. I really like the versatility that this card brings to an Imperial deck and think that as stronger Imperials are created this card will see more and more play.\\par Armaedes made a bunch of good points about this card above, but there were a few things I also wanted to add. First, two copies of this can be played for maximum use, which means twice as many benefits heading your way. It may be overkill in many instances, but if it is worth it, you'll never go without characters ever again. Secondly, there are some creative ways for you to use it as a cycling machine. DDM had an interesting Hunt Down that used a lone Womp Rat to constantly draw against Vader so that he could draw needed Imperials into hand. I also don't think that limited destiny draws as a bad thing- with you constantly weeding out low destiny characters your 2 destinies should be stronger than your opponent's. This is also yet another great battle winning effect that works with many of the other cards on this list.\\par \\par ARMAEDES' TAKE:\\par No argument here, and the two-copies thing is an important point I forgot to mention. I have seen this card used effectively in Hunt Down, BHBM, ISB, Ralltiir, and even some Combat Readiness (V) decks. Like Ability, Ability, Ability (V), it's good because it rewards you for battling by giving you more characters to battle with. Unlike Ability, Ability, Ability (V), it's far more deck-specific, but getting back characters is always a good thing.",

At first, the original strategy was to play a deck with 25 of your planet's Operative because they were broken on their planet. Basically it worked like this; your objective pulled the sites, then once you controlled three, you flipped. The flip side made all lightside drains -1, your operatives added +1 to force drains, deployed for one, forfeit for like 4 or 5, added a destiny at all sites while you had just one operative on the planet, and you retrieved a force every time you simply deployed one to a site. They were even power +2 against a Rebel. This was totally not a Star Wars movie idea, just crap that hurt the game.\\par \\par SPECIAL NOTE: Because of all the problems this objective caused. Decipher created three cards that completely hurt this deck as well as an errata to the rules saying that only one operative may be at a site, anymore would be lost. This objective is considered to be DEAD. Decipher created this idea with no thought of what they were doing. This objective is one that they wish they had never made. It won the '98 worlds for both sides because it was a broken idea.\\par \\par What Changed Since 1st Edition: Nothing, the objective still stinks. You play it, you are doing it as a surprise factor only. The only reason you should win with this objective is against someone who isn't playing with the counter cards or who doesn't know how it works. STAY AWAY!!!",

The trick is that it has to be targeting a Jedi, but frankly most light battling decks are going to be heavy on the Jedi anyway (Mace Windu (V), Qui-Gon Jinn, Obi-Wan Kenobi and possible a Jedi persona of Luke Skywalker). Cancelling battle evasion is obviously a very good thing for a battling deck, but the card doesn't stop there. If your main should survive the battle and are still at the site, and the dark player retaliates, you can use this card to take the first action of the weapons phase, which means you can strike out at one of your opponent's characters before they have a chance to do any tricks with Dr. Evazan or Dark Strike.\\par \\par SHEWSKI'S TAKE:\\par #5?? Aw, man it's my #1. I don't want to steal my own thunder- so read on. I think this was a very good card to come out of the player designed card experiment.\\par When you deploy to battle in modern SWCCG, the biggest thing you fear is the re-beat, where your opponent minimizes your offensive power, reinforces on their turn, and then beats you down. Evasion and character removal are two prime ways to slow down a feisty LS player. IMI takes care of it all. I don't think its specificity is a hindrance at all. Barrier will often be saved for your big guns (Jedi). Most battles involve Jedi (Stunning), and YAB will target those aforementioned big guns. Being able to battle on your own terms is very nice. The secondary text is quite nice as well, as Armaedes pointed out. Though protective in nature, it can turn a defensive battle into an offensive one quickly.\\par \\par ARMAEDES' TAKE:\\par I agree that this is a great card, but #1? This is a very deck-specific card, as it won't work in a battling deck that isn't mains, and even in a mains deck it won't help you with EPP Luke. A very nice card no doubt, as it made my own list, but not an auto-play by any means.",

Since that would require a revision to thousands of cards, that's simply not practical. Every effort has been made to identify and discern what are and are not characteristics. Some may be missing from the list, while others are deliberately absent. Discerning which is which requires a bit of research and judgment.\\par \\par After investigating, we're adding skiff and sandcrawler to the list of characteristics which apply to vehicles.\\par \\par This brings us to the matter of (LS) Intruder Missile. This weapon and its possible interaction with Outrider has been a matter the PC has been considering for some time. By the rules, the one could not deploy on the other, but we were not ignorant of the possibility that this was an error of omission. Having looked through the evidence, we're now confident that Intruder Missile was not intended to work with Outrider.\\par \\par We do not make these decisions lightly, and attempt to be thorough in our research of the original intent of the card interactions. We searched the records of play testing that we have from the development of Shadows of the Empire (the set that was incorporated into Reflections 2). In an original version of the Outrider, it was created to work with Intruder Missile, both via game text and the inclusion of the \"YT-2400\" in the subtype box. However, the game text was stricken over the course of play testing, and the \"YT-2400\" text moved out of the subtype box into the lore. This move was significant - the characteristic rules were well in place at this time, and Decipher had ensured that references to starships were almost entirely to icons or the contents of the subtype box. The only exceptions to this were defined characteristics (all ships are enclosed and all TIE/sa and B-wings are bombers) or squadron designations (which could be found in title, lore, or game text). Decipher, in fact, released only one card which was referenced by its lore instead of subtype: Blockade Flagship, because \"Droid Control Ship\" would not fit in that box - and Decipher then made a note to declare Droid Control Ship a characteristic.\\par \\par Neither of these cases applied to Outrider - our tests using the original templates showed that \"YT-2400\" would fit with room to spare, and we know that Decipher made no such announcement. In addition, the text on Intruder Missile states that it also may deploy on the Falcon. It was not until two years after Intruder Missile came out that a Falcon was created that didn't state \"YT-1300\" in lore (both the original and Lando in Millennium Falcon did). If Decipher intended to reference it in lore, this specific mention wouldn't have been necessary.\\par \\par Given the state of the characteristic rules at the time by Decipher, the striking of the game text, and the deliberate choice to remove a referenced card aspect from the subtype box, we feel this is sufficient evidence to support the existing ruling: Intruder Missile may not deploy on Outrider.\\par \\par Because this matter has confused many players over the years, we are going to issue the following errata to Intruder Missile (LS) in the hopes of minimizing further confusion:\\par \\par LS Intruder Missile:\\par Deploy on your B-wing, Z-95, YT-1300 Transport, or Falcon.

I have personally had Jabba The Hutt (V) cause more than 50 overflow in games, and I know other players who have got that number even higher. With the number of ways dark side has to pull aliens from the deck, and with Jabba (V) doubling the power of almost all of them, you can create devastating beatdowns in record time. The best part is that the Audience Chamber deploys him from Reserve Deck and then Elis Helrot takes him wherever the fighting is. Truly a brutal battling card.\\par \\par SHEWSKI'S TAKE:\\par Well, I might take exception on the power of Scum being focused on him, but you are right that he is a potent card. I mean, winning a battle by 20 and winning it by 40 both hurt your opponent, but both are likely game winners. I didn't rank him on my list since I don't really like what he brings to the world of SWCCG.

The Dark Side is rife with popular ways to get rid of your heroes such as Dr. Evazan, Dark Strike, and Choke Vader. K'lor Slug (and Molator for the DS) helps you avoid painful beatdowns due to sudden losses of power and destiny draws. While this is more like IMI in that it helps your battles hold their effectiveness, the second part of the text goes very well with immunity mains. Your mains can get out at their normal cost, which greatly speeds up the time it takes to get them into play by a turn or more.\\par \\par ARMAEDES' TAKE:\\par Again, I find this less of an offensive aid than a defensive aid, and more of a battle-hindering card than anything else. The dark side's character removal is a big way dark wins battles, so in my opinion taking this away makes effective battling more challenging. I really like this card - I think it is a necessary component of the game - but I'm not sure I would classify it as a battling aid.",

She is a very cheap destiny draw that allows for an early disruption of the Dark Side's setup. Though envisioned as an anti-Senate card, she has many other strong uses. Most used is probably her leader canceling game text, which can set up some beats of her own. She can take the teeth out of Jabba, Xizor, P-59, Fel, Igar, Ephant Mon, Veers, Thrawn, and Tarkin. This text always works as well. Typically, such a powerful card wouldn't be so cheap, but she has been an early thorn in my opponent's side for some time now. Usually my choice for a utility Leia, but Princess Leia (V) deserves consideration as well.\\par \\par ARMAEDES' TAKE:\\par YES! Leia (V) is a fantastic battling card. Not only does she have strong gametext for battling herself, but she also takes a bite out of senate, which is a deck that makes effective battling by the light side more challenging.

At the moment, there are only two ways for the Light Side to initiate a duel. The first is through Jedi Test #6, a strategy not seen very often. The second (and more likely to be seen) is the Interrupt from Tatooine, You'll Find I'm Full Of Surprises, which gives Luke some dueling ability. Lightsaber Parry will be useful against this card, as well as any future duel-initiating ability the Light Side might gain in the future.\\par \\par Lightsaber Parry also provides some interesting Used game text. If the Dark Side has a lightsaber in a just-initiated battle, this card will eliminate the ability of all lightsabers present to target characters. At first glance, this might seem a little silly. After all, while the Light Side won't be slicing and dicing, the Dark Side can't use their lightsabers, either. But there is a method to the madness. The Light Side still outnumbers the Dark in number of characters who can use the various unique lightsabers. In addition, the Light Side has a little more versatility, with Anakin's Lightsaber being usable by either Luke or Leia. These facts add up to a decent chance that the Light Side will have more lightsabers in a battle than the Dark Side. Now, sacrificing Darth Maul's chance to hit an opponent is more than offset by the fact that you have saved several of your characters from the blade.\\par \\par This text can also be useful when you have an important character with a low defense value in the battle. Characters with 1, 2, or even 3 ability are almost sure to be hit by a lightsaber. Now your Dark Jedi can keep that character alive and kicking for at least another turn.

At first, the idea was to play a deck with 25 of your planet's operatives because they were broke on their planet. Basic it worked like this. Your objective pulled the sites, then once you controlled three, you flipped. The flip side made all DS drains -1, your operatives added +1 to force drains, deployed for one, forfeit for like 4 or 5, added a destiny at all sites while you had just one operative on the planet, and you retrieved a force every time you simply deployed one to a site. They were even power +2 against an Imperial. This was totally not a Star Wars movie idea, just crap that hurt the game. The reason this objective was even made was because Lucas denied the creation for some of the card designs only weeks before the release of Special Edition. To fix this last minute problem, the Operative strategy was added without ANY play testing.\\par \\par SPECIAL NOTE: Because of all the problems this objective caused. Decipher created three cards that completely hurt this deck as well as an errata to the rules saying that only one operative may be at a site, anymore would be lost. They also no longer have presence, so they can't control a site by themselves. This objective is considered to be DEAD. Decipher created this idea with no thought of what they were doing. This objective is one that we all wish they had never made. It won the '98 worlds for both sides because it was a broken idea.",

Light Side players have been able to pull Lightsabers out of their decks for years with Gift Of The Mentor, and now Maul Strikes allows the Dark Side to finally have their turn at this great ability.\\par \\par Another minor weakness of the Tatooine persona of Darth Maul was that his ability to duel was a bit restricted, since he had to essentially survive an entire turn before he had the chance to duel anybody. With Maul Strikes, however, the Sith Lord can bypass that restriction, and duel at any time by simply playing this interrupt.\\par \\par And finally, if you're looking for just some good old beatdown, Maul can add battle destiny with this card too. Instead of just dueling Qui-Gon and making him lost, why not battle him, cut him, and draw three battle destiny as well? The answer is simple.",

The Dark Side is rife with popular ways to get rid of your heroes such as Dr. Evazan, Dark Strike, and Choke Vader. K'lor Slug (and Molator for the DS) helps you avoid painful beatdowns due to sudden losses of power and destiny draws. While this is more like IMI in that it helps your battles hold their effectiveness, the second part of the text goes very well with immunity mains. Your mains can get out at their normal cost, which greatly speeds up the time it takes to get them into play by a turn or more.\\par \\par ARMAEDES' TAKE:\\par Again, I find this less of an offensive aid than a defensive aid, and more of a battle-hindering card than anything else. The dark side's character removal is a big way dark wins battles, so in my opinion taking this away makes effective battling more challenging. I really like this card - I think it is a necessary component of the game - but I'm not sure I would classify it as a battling aid.",

In actuality, it will create more problems than it solves. A single exception was created for gender, since this was leading to problems that couldn't be resolved short of issuing a list of gender clarifications. Greg Anderson felt that players should be able to use the existing information on the card to identify a gender characteristic, a position that Chuck Sonnenburg continued to support when he took over. But it was agreed that this would be the only exception ever - that coming up with a list of what would and would not apply to the picture would only add another layer of complexity to the rules.\\par \\par An effort was made to instead shore up the issues by cleaning up the characteristics list, which can be noted by a comparison between the AR and previous rules documents; things like DH-17 and fusion generator have been added, and ones that did not fit in have been removed.\\par \\par In an ideal world we would reissue every single card with all the characteristics on the card and do away with these rules altogether - but at this time this is simply not feasible.

For this reason, the site will have its game text errata'd so that the correct term, \"AAT\" is used.\\par \\par Naboo: Battle Plains (DS) DS text will read:\\par Unless Gungan Energy Shield on table, your AATs are each power +2 here.\\par \\par Naboo: Battle Plains (LS) DS text will read:\\par Your AATs deploy +1 here.\\par \\par There has been some discussion recently about how applying the picture to the ways of identifying would solve this problem. In actuality, it will create more problems than it solves. A single exception was created for gender, since this was leading to problems that couldn't be resolved short of issuing a list of gender clarifications. Greg Anderson felt that players should be able to use the existing information on the card to identify a gender characteristic, a position that Chuck Sonnenburg continued to support when he took over. But it was agreed that this would be the only exception ever - that coming up with a list of what would and would not apply to the picture would only add another layer of complexity to the rules.\\par \\par An effort was made to instead shore up the issues by cleaning up the characteristics list, which can be noted by a comparison between the AR and previous rules documents; things like DH-17 and fusion generator have been added, and ones that did not fit in have been removed.\\par \\par In an ideal world we would reissue every single card with all the characteristics on the card and do away with these rules altogether - but at this time this is simply not feasible. We have, we believe, the best possible alternative in place. ",

Since that would require a revision to thousands of cards, that's simply not practical. Every effort has been made to identify and discern what are and are not characteristics. Some may be missing from the list, while others are deliberately absent. Discerning which is which requires a bit of research and judgment.\\par \\par After investigating, we're adding skiff and sandcrawler to the list of characteristics which apply to vehicles.\\par \\par This brings us to the matter of (LS) Intruder Missile. This weapon and its possible interaction with Outrider has been a matter the PC has been considering for some time. By the rules, the one could not deploy on the other, but we were not ignorant of the possibility that this was an error of omission. Having looked through the evidence, we're now confident that Intruder Missile was not intended to work with Outrider.\\par \\par We do not make these decisions lightly, and attempt to be thorough in our research of the original intent of the card interactions. We searched the records of play testing that we have from the development of Shadows of the Empire (the set that was incorporated into Reflections 2). In an original version of the Outrider, it was created to work with Intruder Missile, both via game text and the inclusion of the \"YT-2400\" in the subtype box. However, the game text was stricken over the course of play testing, and the \"YT-2400\" text moved out of the subtype box into the lore. This move was significant - the characteristic rules were well in place at this time, and Decipher had ensured that references to starships were almost entirely to icons or the contents of the subtype box. The only exceptions to this were defined characteristics (all ships are enclosed and all TIE/sa and B-wings are bombers) or squadron designations (which could be found in title, lore, or game text). Decipher, in fact, released only one card which was referenced by its lore instead of subtype: Blockade Flagship, because \"Droid Control Ship\" would not fit in that box - and Decipher then made a note to declare Droid Control Ship a characteristic.\\par \\par Neither of these cases applied to Outrider - our tests using the original templates showed that \"YT-2400\" would fit with room to spare, and we know that Decipher made no such announcement. In addition, the text on Intruder Missile states that it also may deploy on the Falcon. It was not until two years after Intruder Missile came out that a Falcon was created that didn't state \"YT-1300\" in lore (both the original and Lando in Millennium Falcon did). If Decipher intended to reference it in lore, this specific mention wouldn't have been necessary.\\par \\par Given the state of the characteristic rules at the time by Decipher, the striking of the game text, and the deliberate choice to remove a referenced card aspect from the subtype box, we feel this is sufficient evidence to support the existing ruling: Intruder Missile may not deploy on Outrider.\\par \\par Because this matter has confused many players over the years, we are going to issue the following errata to Intruder Missile (LS) in the hopes of minimizing further confusion:\\par \\par LS Intruder Missile:\\par Deploy on your B-wing, Z-95, YT-1300 Transport, or Falcon. May target a capital starship for free. Draw destiny. Add 3 if that capital starship was targeted by another weapon this turn. Target hit if total destiny > defense value.

    "Information": "Traditionally, non-lightsaber weapon cards haven't fared too well in SWCCG decks. For one thing, it is difficult to get both the character and his matching weapon into play together without packing extra copies of both cards. And once the weapon is in play, it tends to have a lower chance of hitting a high defense value target than those lightsabers that get two weapon destinies. Finally, most weapons don't have the extra damage that lightsabers can cause through Force drains. Panaka's Blaster looks to be the weapon that bucks the binder fodder trend.\\par \\par Panaka's Blaster can easily get on the table, since Captain Panaka's game text allows you to deploy a blaster from your Reserve deck. That solves the problem of getting the weapon out where it will do some good. It also has a very respectable chance of hitting a target, requiring a weapon destiny +2 greater than the target's defense value. Of course, the weapon destiny draw can be boosted with cards like Blaster Proficiency.\\par \\par Beyond these basic characteristics, Panaka's Blaster has two more things going for it. First, if the blaster hits a target in a battle, the Light Side's total power in that battle is +3. The final bonus comes from game text on Captain Panaka: if Panaka hits a character with a blaster, your opponent has to lose 2 Force. This text is an interesting bit of direct damage that encourages the Light Side to battle early and often.\\par \\par And for those players who really miss the Force drain bonus of lightsabers, there's always the used interrupt Rebel Artillery, which causes a 1 Force loss at a site you control where a non-lightsaber weapon is present.

She may look beguilingly gentle, and most the time she is, but behind that enigmatic smile lies a woman you want on your side when you lead your forces into opposition territory!\\par \\par Ability 4 is a great start. Add the fact that she is an experienced and effective +2 pilot, and it's now definitely worth paying 4 to deploy her. She's even immune to M'iiyoom! Do you believe though that you can deploy her for free to any docking bay!? Usually not hard to find one of those in today's environment! The ability to deploy free is huge, and almost single-handedly justifies her inclusion in most Light Side decks. For example, stock a docking bay and Insurrection (who doesn't? Especially with a combo version imminent!) and she can now be added to even your world-beating Watch Your Step deck.\\par \\par All this, and we haven't even got to the kicker. Get her to your opponent's docking bay, preferably with a little backup (cause she attracts a lot of attention!), and suddenly the opponent may be left regretting that he ever started with Imperial Arrest Order. Your characters there receive a boosted defense value, and even some immunity. This all represents the fact that this lady of the hyperspace lane knows her way around spaceports as if she was born there.\\par \\par If your Phylo-led expeditionary force takes the docking bay for their own, your drains there are now +2. Thats a drain of 3 at every one of a dozen of your opponent's docking bays. If you are protecting her with an appropriately armed Qui-Gon (who is now defense value 8!), then that saber will be adding to the Force drain insult.\\par \\par With that sort of damage, suddenly your opponent is being forcibly diverted from more important tasks (like flipping his objective) as he is comitted to throwing resources to defend what was only going to be a site for a little force-generation. That may well tilt the game your way.\\par \\par So with this wonder woman on your side, what do you have to fear? Weapon fire and attrition are the biggest threats, as Gandish may very well be the only one of your characters at that location who is not immune. As for weapons, sabers will paint her with a big target sign, and 4-LOM may very well find her to be a firm favorite in his targeting reticle. If you want to play sneaky, put her inside a vehicle for a little weapon and choke protection, perhaps even aboard a Rogue Squadron snowspeeder for some immunity as well (if you can get the appropriate pilot aboard). Remember, she will still be working her magic, and also adding 2 power - more than she would if left exposed on the ground.\\par \\par Keep an eye out for this great gal! You're going to be seeing a lot of her. And remember, beware the double-edged sword that is the unattended docking bay!",

    "Rules": "(AR 1.7.1, B-12)\\par Effects that are \"always immune to Alter\" means any Effect which is unconditionally immune to Alter according to it's own game text, as these conditions must be met before such an Effect is on table. Therefore cards that are immune to Alter based on a condition in their game text (such as Come Here You Big Coward) cannot be deployed with this starting interrupt. Cards which are immune to Alter in their game text but can have that immunity canceled by other cards may be deployed using this Interrupt. For example, Prepared Defenses could still be used to deploy Mobilization Points even if Don't Do That Again was on table. When deploying Effects using this Starting Interrupt, each Effect deploys separately, and all automatic actions resolve normally. Thus if this starting interrupt is used to deploy Naboo Occupation, No Escape, and Imperial Arrest Order, Naboo Occupation may be deployed first (and will be immediately lost), followed by No Escape (which allows the dark side player to take the top card of the lost pile into hand) followed by Imperial Arrest Order.",

Like the traditional cards, this may be played when you have Leia and Chewie together in a battle. Your benefit is 2 added battle destiny. This is an impressive twist, as all other of the destiny-adding teamwork cards involve Luke. In a Teamwork-based deck, this can surprise an opponent who expects these powerful interrupts only from combinations involving Luke. And no one can deny the power of an extra 2 destiny in a battle, especially in a high destiny deck, as a Teamwork deck tends to be.\\par \\par The extra text is quite useful. In fact, I'd venture to say that it is the most powerful yet. It allows you, if Leia is in a battle, to forfeit Chewie from your hand to satisfy all battle damage and attrition. This is quite nasty in conjunction with a few other cards. Obviously, you can use this to keep a squad of characters on the Death Star while your opponent is forced to lose some of his built up defense, but there are more subtle strategies.\\par \\par One is an odd twist on the familiar Ghhhk strategy. One would play a lone TIE Fighter at a system and drain. When the opponent deployed there, he would play a Lone Pilot and then Ghhhk to avoid the damage. You can do something similar with this, and, in fact, the effect is much more devastating. With Princess Leia on the table, if you play Warrior's Courage, you get 3 battle destiny when she's alone. Then, simply play Protector, and lose Chewie, and she stays on the table. Doubly effective if she's been trained, or if she's carrying a Lightsaber.\\par \\par The added cancelling ability can be useful as well, cancelling two very annoying interrupts. Frustration can be a pain in a deck designed for it, and cancelling I'd Just As Soon Kiss A Wookiee can be an added reassurance that your cards are going to get into play.",

By keeping Rennek with your small power characters, you can use their game texts longer. The second part of his game text is also interesting: you can raise Rennek's Power three times per turn for only one Force each time! In the mid-game, when you have plenty of Force, Rennek is an argument that your opponent will have to consider.

    "Information": "One of the many force retrieval methods for the Light Side, Rycar's Run stands above the rest. First of all, it is efficiant. Combined with an Asteroid Sancuary deck, you don't have to put in any useless cards to make Rycar's Run work. The only other things you need are Closers, and those have a destiny of 6, and they are used. Rycar's run also only takes 2 turns to pull off, if you use a Closer each turn. Also, you get 8 Force (assuming all asteroid sectors are present, which shouldn't be a problem in an Asteroid Sanctuary deck) for just losing 1 card and using others that you would be using regardless. No destiny draws, you know what you are getting, and it sets you up for another 'Run. You can't lose it by having your target/ship killed with an Interrupt like Gravity Shadow with Kessel Run, or Look Sir, Droids with Death Star Plans.\\par \\par The problem arises with that one turn where your ship gets stranded out at the Big One. This is easily conquered with Cap'n Han on the Falcon with R2-D2, Chewie, and maybe even some Special Mods. Or even R2-D2 and Luke on Red 5. This pretty much makes your ship tough to get with battles, and nearly impossible (watch out for DS asteroid decks) to kill with Asteroids, ensuring that the 'Run goes through. So, what Rycar's Run actually does for your Asteroid Sancuary Deck is to make you last longer against ground-drain decks without incorporating unreliable undercover spies. I would recommend putting about 4 of them in a Sancuary deck, along with 6 Closers. ",

After all, the best draining sites for the Dark Side were almost exclusively exterior! Virtually every Dark Side site with a Force drain for two or more was an exterior site like the Tatooine: Lars' Moisture Farm, Tatooine: Jundland Wastes, or Hoth: Defensive Perimeter.\\par With the release of Cloud City, the Dark Side now has a set of interior sites with decent draining opportunities. Unlike the Death Star or Executor sites, these have Light Side icons allowing a modest drain. Adding Dark Deal to a Cloud City deck could be devastating to an ill-prepared Light Side deck. With lightsabers and Dark Deal, Cloud City is an okay place to Force drain for the Dark Side. Oh, and don't forget about Bounty Hunting opportunities.\\par \\par Along with Cloud City's interior sites came a nice Used Interrupt called Trooper Assault. This card simulates the endless hordes of troopers the Imperial Army seems to muster by making all Dark Side troopers in a battle power +2 and immune to all attrition. This one interrupt almost single-handedly made troopers viable again.\\par \\par So where does Stunning Leader fit into the equation? Well, consider a Cloud City Force drain deck with troopers as its primary site defenses. Every site (don't use the Docking Bay) is interior, meaning Stunning Leader can be played at a site battle anywhere.

This site, when combined with Tatooine: Cantina, form a strong site combination.\\par \\par Of primary importance is the ability to move Light Side characters for free during the control phase. This affords the Light Side player a number of large strategic advantages. First, this provides excellent force generation and Force drain opportunities. That the Dark Side gains some force generation is somewhat negated by the fact that they will have to play a sufficient Force at both sites to force a battle. With the Tatooine: Mos Eisley game text, avoiding the Dark Side task force is free, while the Dark Side player must pay to chase from site to site. The Light Side player can keep her entire force strong and protected at one location and still Force drain at both sites. If the Dark Side has no presence at either site, and the Light Side has at least two characters deployed at one of the sites, just move one character to the second site, execute both Force drains, and then move the rest of the characters over. Keep in mind that this counts as their movement for the turn.\\par To completely halt the force drains, the Dark Side will have to split her forces between the two sites. When it is advantageous, the Light Side player can use the free move in the control phase to move her whole Force over and attack immediately.\\par \\par Two types of cards will augment this deck greatly. First, the Light Side player must keep the Dark Side from deploying and immediately initiating a battle. Narrow Escape and Rebel Barrier can both help with this, and the A NEw Hope cards I Have a Very Bad Feeling About This and R2-D2 with a Fire Extinguisher work as well. If the battle does start, Houjix can keep the results from being crippling by eliminating force loss. Lightsabers and Lightsaber Proficiency increase the Force drain at the sites, also a key. Quite a Mercenary will keep the Dark Side from launching a surprise attack via Elis Helrot. Include multiple Tatooine: Mos Eisley to keep them from being reversed.\\par \\par Cards to watch out for: Dark Side Tatooine: Mos Eisley, Counter Assault.",

Cantina is a 2/2 site and Mos Eisley lets you move to and from there for free during your control phase.\\par So, stack your characters on one of those two sites to better withstand a battle, then on your control phase move some of them over to the other, drain at both, and then move the ones you didn't move yet to re-consolidate your forces.\\par -----\\par Tatooine: Mos Eisley + Spaceport Speeders\\par Once you're there movement is free, so you don't need the speeder anymore.

Threepio shares Mirax Terrik's ability to circulate high destiny cards back into your deck and replace them with new cards from the Reserve Deck. What's even nicer about Threepio's ability is that, unlike Mirax, his ability can be used for free, and instead of placing the card on the bottom of the Used Pile, he places it on the top of the Used Pile for easier tracking when your Reserve Deck is larger.\\par \\par The other nice thing about Threepio's ability to place a high destiny card on top of your Used Pile is that if he's in a battle with Shmi, he can then take that high destiny card and place it on top of your Reserve Deck, ensuring a nice pull for weapon or battle destiny. And since Shmi can download Threepio right out of the Reserve Deck, the odds of you having them in a battle together are pretty good.\\par \\par The fact that this is a persona of C-3PO also has enormous benefits. Because most versions of C-3PO have only been strong in specialized decks, many of his support cards are quite powerful. For example, Were You Looking For Me? is a handy 5 Destiny Used Interrupt that allows you to pull Threepio and/or another protocol droid (like R-3PO) from your Reserve Deck. You can also use the same Interrupt as a Lost Interrupt to either retrieve Threepio from the Lost Pile or to add a battle destiny when Threepio is helping his friends out in battle (two battle destiny if he happens to have a few furry friends with him). Unlike most \"back\" cards, this card is very appealing because it's recyclable, free, high destiny, and has the battle destiny bonus.\\par \\par There are tons of other C-3PO suppport cards, including the ever-popular How Did We Get Into This Mess?, but one of my favorites is Artoo, I Have A Bad Feeling About This, which has three different uses, the best of which allows you to squash your opponent's battle destiny completely if both Artoo and C-3PO are together in battle. Put Shmi, Artoo and Threepio together in a battle, and with the right support cards you can really put the hurt on the Dark Side.",

This means that you can lose the key cards to the freezing process early, knowing that you can get them back later in the game.

Some solutions that have worked to one extent or another have been Demotion, Tarkin Seeker and playing space decks. An opinion that some top ranked players hold is that Vader is wasted in space when compared with his devastating effectiveness at sites. Uncontrollable Fury is another tool in this war. While there is a Dark Side card that can cancel it, the power of Uncontrollable Fury probably makes it more than worth the risk.\\par \\par There are numerous avoidance strategies that can make use of the Force loss part of the card. The easiest of these is just to use Nabrun Leids to move away from Vader in each of the Dark Side's battle phases, and cause them to lose two Force per opponent's turn.

However, after deploying something like an Executor, or a normal star destroyer with pilots, you should have an interesting Used Pile. If you have plenty weapons in your deck, chances are good that you find a weapon there. This is also a very strong point, as you can take ONE weapon. It does not specify which weapon. Find a Superlaser there ? Take it. Vader needs his custom slice-toy and it's in the Used Pile ? Pick out Vader's Lightsaber and take it into your hand. Want to arm that star destroyer ? Weapon Levitate the Turbolaser Battery or Ion Cannon you see in your Used Pile. The possibilities are only limited by the weapons in your deck.\\par \\par There is another use, the Lost Interrupt variant. For fun I'll give an example which actually happened. I had an unarmed Darth Vader at a site. Here comes Obi-Wan with a generic Jedi Lightsaber (his own toy was not deployed yet). Obi starts to battle and suddenly he feels the lightsaber wrenched from his grip, sees it flying through the room and into Darth Vaders hands. The last thing Obi-Wan ever saw, was Darth Vader slicing him with Obi's own surrogate toy.\\par \\par In the game, Obi-Wan started the battle and I played Weapon Levitation as a Lost Interrupt. I snatched the Jedi Lightsaber and, as it can be used by any warrior, used it to slice Obi-Wan to ribbons. However, things get a little more interesting. The game text states, that you may 'steal' one character weapon present. OK, so you will not run off with a Planet Defender Ion Cannon. However, did you see Luke waving his Blaster Pistol (and you fear he will target you, to make Darth lose the immunity to attrition) ? 'Steal' the pistol. It is a character weapon. Do you see Djas Puhr against a Light Side character with a Blaster Rifle and your opponent starts the fight ? Use Weapon Levitation to 'steal' the rifle. You see, the great part is, that neither specific weapons, nor specific characters are mentioned. Any character of ability >3 can steal any character weapon (so you might even get a weapon back thet the Light Side once stole from you !).\\par \\par In short, a good card to include in any deck, especially if you have a lot of weapons, a lot of ability 4+ characters, ... or both.\\par \\par Strong points:\\par * Weapon Levitation = Destiny 4 - good to upgrade average destiny, good to draw destiny.\\par * Weapon Levitation = Two cards for the price of one (Used and Lost variant).\\par * Weapon Levitation = Uncommon, thus it should not be too hard to get.\\par * Weapon Levitation = Surprise, as in, surprise your opponent by using his weapons against him, or at least get your weapons fast.\\par \\par \\par Weak points:\\par * Weapon Levitation = Not immune, so a Sense could ruin this little plan.\\par * Weapon Levitation = Unique.

This is very obnoxious to do after Mara or Son Of Skywalker has used their \"once per game\" ability. Putting an opponent's lightsaber into the Used Pile is beneficial since it takes away the Force drain bonus for the following turn, and it removes the battle / duel advantage that a saber provides. Also, late in the game, you can put one of your lightsabers into your Used Pile to help boost your differential. As a Lost Interrupt, this works even better for this purpose, as you may place any or all of your devices and character weapons on table into your Used Pile. These counterparts are a must in any deck utilizing a quantity of devices and character weapons, and allows them to be used without the disadvantage of being too card-intensive. For a funny Light Side combo, put a bunch on high destiny devices into the Used Pile while Descent Into The Dark is out, then battle or Surprise Assault.",

These cards show relationships between Light Side characters at vulnerable moments. Scruffy Looking Nerf Herder is the first and best-known of these tension cards. In Scruffy Looking Nerf Herder, Leia and Han's usual strong bond hits a weak spot and allows the Dark Side to draw two destiny and to subtract that amount from the Light Side opponent's attrition and total power.\\par \\par Since every Light Side deck uses Luke in one form or another, including a card to counter an opponent using one of the personas of Luke is a good idea. Why Didn't You Tell Me? cancels Gift Of The Mentor and the popular Force regeneration card, Noble Sacrifice. It's a rare game when Yoda doesn't bite the big one because of Noble Sacrifice (gaining the Light Side 9 Force!), so canceling it is good idea.\\par \\par In a battle against Luke, Why Didn't You Tell Me can hamper your opponent significantly. Some of the Light Side strategies deal with simply deploying a main character, and trying to chip away at the an opposing vehicle, character, or starship, and hope that the other cards' Forfeit guides them through the Force loss. With a good destiny draw, this hope can be at least stemmed, as those cards battle destiny dwindles from a five or six to a mere one or two.

If you choose No Escape as one of your starting effects, this direct damage will not be cancelled by Honor of the Jedi, which is a good thing since your force drains at non-battlegrounds will be negated by that powerful Light Side card. Be sure to pack a couple Presence of the Force to help turn those Marker Sites into battlegrounds and add to your drains in the bargain.\\par \\par For a third starting effect for this deck type, you probably want to start with Imperial Arrest Order. This will give a big boost to all your Walker pilots, and allow you to deploy the Hoth: Echo Docking Bay right away, a great place to plop a Walker to help drain with Walker Garrison.

Well, if you're willing to devote a few extra cards to your Mains deck, this card can certainly be an unwelcome surprise for the Dark Side. Most decks carry a Vader or three, so devoting a bit of your strategy to this card can usually be effective. And it is a 6 Destiny card, so it will always have that bit of usefulness. Now, play two or three of these cards in your deck, and you've got some of the high destiny you need to succeed with this card.\\par \\par Also, pack Courage of Skywalker to give you another destiny to even things out a bit with the old Dark Lord. And let's not forget Glancing Blow, which allows you to cancel one of the Dark Side's duelling destiny draws or, if you play You'll Find I'm Full of Surprises during the weapons segment of a battle, you can use Glancing Blow to nail Vader's power, knocking it to an unmodifiable zero, which means he won't even get the +2 power from holding his lightsaber granted by the Interrupt. Suddenly, Vader's chances of winning have become quite slim, and it looks like he's going away for a very long time.\\par \\par Having this sort of a side strategy not only lets you beat up Luke's favorite sparring partner, but also gives you a plethora of cards to defend yourself during duels initiated by the Dark Side with such cards as Epic Duel or new cards like Darth Maul.\\par \\par Some new Tatooine cards that can help you win the day versus Vader include A Jedi's Focus: which lets you add the destiny of the top card of the Lost Pile to your total, A Jedi's Patience: which lets you redraw one of your bad duelling destiny draws, and most importantly, A Jedi's Resilience, which allows you to cancel a duel AFTER you've lost it AND take the duelling card back into your hand!\\par \\par But watch out for the new Dark Side card, Lightsaber Parry, or your duel might suddenly become very expensive!",

    "Rules": "Draw X Choose Y\\par When a card instructs you to draw x destiny and choose y, perform the following steps:\\par Step 1) Draw a destiny. This draw can be modified, canceled, reset, or otherwise responded to normally just after it is drawn; however, after being drawn, unless canceled, it remains an Unresolved Destiny Draw and is not yet placed in Used Pile. The draw is considered a weapon destiny, battle destiny, etc. where appropriate, and counts against any applicable limits. If a limit prevents a player from drawing more than x destinies, they instead draw a number of destinies equal to the limit. Repeat this step until x destinies have been drawn. \\par Step 2) Once x destines have been drawn, choose a destiny from among the Unresolved Destiny Draws and resolve it normally. Repeat this step until an appropriate number of destinies have been chosen as specified by y. \\par Step 3) Place any remaining unresolved draws in used pile (unless otherwise instructed) in the order they were drawn (if possible).\\par \\par \\par Note that this means any just action responding to a just drawn destiny in a Draw X Choose Y situation must do so when it is DRAWN (in step 1) and not when it is CHOSEN (in step 2). Once the process has moved on to Step 2, with the player who drew choosing which destinies to use, the draws can no longer be responded to as just drawn. \\par \\par Also worth noting is that all destinies drawn with a Draw X Choose Y card count against applicable limits or other cards that count the number of destinies, even if they are not chosen. That is to say, limits count the number of destinies drawn, not the number of destinies chosen. To illustrate, here are a few examples: \\par \\par Example 1: Dash In Rogue 12 (applicable text: During battle, if with another T-47 and about to draw a battle destiny, may draw two and choose one.) is in a battle with another T-47, and the Light Side player is limited to ONE battle destiny. In this situation Dash In Rogue 12's 'draw 2 and choose 1' text cannot be used because both destinies drawn with Dash count as battle destiny draws. \\par \\par Example 2: If a similar situation played out, but the Light Side player was limited 2 battle destinies instead of 1, the Light Side player using Dash In Rogue 12's text on 1 destiny would reach the limit of two battle destinies on its own, because even though only one such destiny would be chosen, two destinies were still drawn. If the light side player had a way to add a battle destiny in this example, they would be better off NOT using Dash In Rogue 12's text and simply drawing 2 normal destinies, because using Dash In Rogue 12's text on the first destiny would cause them to reach the limit of 2, preventing them from drawing the added battle destiny after. \\par \\par Example 3: Dash In Rogue 12 is in a battle with Commander Luke Skywalker v piloting Rogue 1 (so that Luke draws 2 battle destiny if unable to otherwise). Luke's text will be usable because when it checks how many destinies Light Side is scheduled to draw at the beginning of the power segment, it will only see 1. (Luke's text only counts one destiny able to be drawn because Dash In Rogue 12's text has not triggered yet - it is only usable when the Light Side is about to draw a battle destiny) While the Light Side may theoretically use Dash In Rogue 12's text to draw 2 and choose 1 on the first destiny drawn, they would no longer be able to draw the 2nd destiny with Luke's text, because players may never combine multiple destiny drawing to draw more than the 'if unable to otherwise' text allows (see \"Battle Destiny - Draws X Battle Destiny If Unable To Otherwise\" on AR page 6-6). In this case, drawing 2 and choosing 1 on the first destiny and attempting to draw the second would mean the Light Side would be drawing 3 battle destinies, which would be prevented by 'if unable to otherwise' rules. If the first destiny with Luke's text is drawn normally, the Light Side player may not use Dash In Rogue 12's text on the second destiny from Luke's text, because again, that would result in the Light Side player drawing 3 destinies and would be prevented. In short, like example 2, the Light Side player would be better off simply drawing 2 normal battle destinies rather than using Dash In Rogue 12's text in this situation.",
