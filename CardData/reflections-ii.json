Since that would require a revision to thousands of cards, that's simply not practical. Every effort has been made to identify and discern what are and are not characteristics. Some may be missing from the list, while others are deliberately absent. Discerning which is which requires a bit of research and judgment.\\par \\par After investigating, we're adding skiff and sandcrawler to the list of characteristics which apply to vehicles.\\par \\par This brings us to the matter of (LS) Intruder Missile. This weapon and its possible interaction with Outrider has been a matter the PC has been considering for some time. By the rules, the one could not deploy on the other, but we were not ignorant of the possibility that this was an error of omission. Having looked through the evidence, we're now confident that Intruder Missile was not intended to work with Outrider.\\par \\par We do not make these decisions lightly, and attempt to be thorough in our research of the original intent of the card interactions. We searched the records of play testing that we have from the development of Shadows of the Empire (the set that was incorporated into Reflections 2). In an original version of the Outrider, it was created to work with Intruder Missile, both via game text and the inclusion of the \"YT-2400\" in the subtype box. However, the game text was stricken over the course of play testing, and the \"YT-2400\" text moved out of the subtype box into the lore. This move was significant - the characteristic rules were well in place at this time, and Decipher had ensured that references to starships were almost entirely to icons or the contents of the subtype box. The only exceptions to this were defined characteristics (all ships are enclosed and all TIE/sa and B-wings are bombers) or squadron designations (which could be found in title, lore, or game text). Decipher, in fact, released only one card which was referenced by its lore instead of subtype: Blockade Flagship, because \"Droid Control Ship\" would not fit in that box - and Decipher then made a note to declare Droid Control Ship a characteristic.\\par \\par Neither of these cases applied to Outrider - our tests using the original templates showed that \"YT-2400\" would fit with room to spare, and we know that Decipher made no such announcement. In addition, the text on Intruder Missile states that it also may deploy on the Falcon. It was not until two years after Intruder Missile came out that a Falcon was created that didn't state \"YT-1300\" in lore (both the original and Lando in Millennium Falcon did). If Decipher intended to reference it in lore, this specific mention wouldn't have been necessary.\\par \\par Given the state of the characteristic rules at the time by Decipher, the striking of the game text, and the deliberate choice to remove a referenced card aspect from the subtype box, we feel this is sufficient evidence to support the existing ruling: Intruder Missile may not deploy on Outrider.\\par \\par Because this matter has confused many players over the years, we are going to issue the following errata to Intruder Missile (LS) in the hopes of minimizing further confusion:\\par \\par LS Intruder Missile:\\par Deploy on your B-wing, Z-95, YT-1300 Transport, or Falcon.
