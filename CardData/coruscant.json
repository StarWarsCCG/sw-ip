    "Information": "Traditionally, non-lightsaber weapon cards haven't fared too well in SWCCG decks. For one thing, it is difficult to get both the character and his matching weapon into play together without packing extra copies of both cards. And once the weapon is in play, it tends to have a lower chance of hitting a high defense value target than those lightsabers that get two weapon destinies. Finally, most weapons don't have the extra damage that lightsabers can cause through Force drains. Panaka's Blaster looks to be the weapon that bucks the binder fodder trend.\\par \\par Panaka's Blaster can easily get on the table, since Captain Panaka's game text allows you to deploy a blaster from your Reserve deck. That solves the problem of getting the weapon out where it will do some good. It also has a very respectable chance of hitting a target, requiring a weapon destiny +2 greater than the target's defense value. Of course, the weapon destiny draw can be boosted with cards like Blaster Proficiency.\\par \\par Beyond these basic characteristics, Panaka's Blaster has two more things going for it. First, if the blaster hits a target in a battle, the Light Side's total power in that battle is +3. The final bonus comes from game text on Captain Panaka: if Panaka hits a character with a blaster, your opponent has to lose 2 Force. This text is an interesting bit of direct damage that encourages the Light Side to battle early and often.\\par \\par And for those players who really miss the Force drain bonus of lightsabers, there's always the used interrupt Rebel Artillery, which causes a 1 Force loss at a site you control where a non-lightsaber weapon is present. In battle, this interrupt can also cause an additional Force loss when Panaka hits a character. Overall, Panaka's Blaster is one of the most attractive weapons without a glowing blade this game has seen. ",

She may look beguilingly gentle, and most the time she is, but behind that enigmatic smile lies a woman you want on your side when you lead your forces into opposition territory!\\par \\par Ability 4 is a great start. Add the fact that she is an experienced and effective +2 pilot, and it's now definitely worth paying 4 to deploy her. She's even immune to M'iiyoom! Do you believe though that you can deploy her for free to any docking bay!? Usually not hard to find one of those in today's environment! The ability to deploy free is huge, and almost single-handedly justifies her inclusion in most Light Side decks. For example, stock a docking bay and Insurrection (who doesn't? Especially with a combo version imminent!) and she can now be added to even your world-beating Watch Your Step deck.\\par \\par All this, and we haven't even got to the kicker. Get her to your opponent's docking bay, preferably with a little backup (cause she attracts a lot of attention!), and suddenly the opponent may be left regretting that he ever started with Imperial Arrest Order. Your characters there receive a boosted defense value, and even some immunity. This all represents the fact that this lady of the hyperspace lane knows her way around spaceports as if she was born there.\\par \\par If your Phylo-led expeditionary force takes the docking bay for their own, your drains there are now +2. Thats a drain of 3 at every one of a dozen of your opponent's docking bays. If you are protecting her with an appropriately armed Qui-Gon (who is now defense value 8!), then that saber will be adding to the Force drain insult.\\par \\par With that sort of damage, suddenly your opponent is being forcibly diverted from more important tasks (like flipping his objective) as he is comitted to throwing resources to defend what was only going to be a site for a little force-generation. That may well tilt the game your way.\\par \\par So with this wonder woman on your side, what do you have to fear? Weapon fire and attrition are the biggest threats, as Gandish may very well be the only one of your characters at that location who is not immune. As for weapons, sabers will paint her with a big target sign, and 4-LOM may very well find her to be a firm favorite in his targeting reticle. If you want to play sneaky, put her inside a vehicle for a little weapon and choke protection, perhaps even aboard a Rogue Squadron snowspeeder for some immunity as well (if you can get the appropriate pilot aboard). Remember, she will still be working her magic, and also adding 2 power - more than she would if left exposed on the ground.\\par \\par Keep an eye out for this great gal! You're going to be seeing a lot of her. And remember, beware the double-edged sword that is the unattended docking bay!",
