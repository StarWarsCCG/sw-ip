Similarly, if cards are removed from the location during the resolution (such as by a Program Trap), they will still contribute power and still add a destiny draw for purposes of resolving the Counter Assault. This Interrupt does not cause a battle and thus cards may not be forfeited to reduce Force loss. Remember that, at a system location, characters and vehicles aboard starships are not present at the system. Therefore, for Counter Assault there will ordinarily only be one destiny draw per starship at the system but none for any cards aboard. Counter Assault may technically be played at a holosite but, since there are no characters present (only dejariks and holograms), no destiny will be drawn and zero will be compared to the opponent's total power.",

    "Information": "Tatooine: Mos Eisley is the cornerstone for a Tatooine ground Force drain deck. The key to this strategy is to stay away from the Dark Side ground forces while continuing to force drain. Eventually, an opportunity usually presents itself to make a crippling counter-attack. This site, when combined with Tatooine: Cantina, form a strong site combination.\\par \\par Of primary importance is the ability to move Light Side characters for free during the control phase. This affords the Light Side player a number of large strategic advantages. First, this provides excellent force generation and Force drain opportunities. That the Dark Side gains some force generation is somewhat negated by the fact that they will have to play a sufficient Force at both sites to force a battle. With the Tatooine: Mos Eisley game text, avoiding the Dark Side task force is free, while the Dark Side player must pay to chase from site to site. The Light Side player can keep her entire force strong and protected at one location and still Force drain at both sites. If the Dark Side has no presence at either site, and the Light Side has at least two characters deployed at one of the sites, just move one character to the second site, execute both Force drains, and then move the rest of the characters over. Keep in mind that this counts as their movement for the turn.\\par To completely halt the force drains, the Dark Side will have to split her forces between the two sites. When it is advantageous, the Light Side player can use the free move in the control phase to move her whole Force over and attack immediately.\\par \\par Two types of cards will augment this deck greatly. First, the Light Side player must keep the Dark Side from deploying and immediately initiating a battle. Narrow Escape and Rebel Barrier can both help with this, and the A NEw Hope cards I Have a Very Bad Feeling About This and R2-D2 with a Fire Extinguisher work as well. If the battle does start, Houjix can keep the results from being crippling by eliminating force loss. Lightsabers and Lightsaber Proficiency increase the Force drain at the sites, also a key. Quite a Mercenary will keep the Dark Side from launching a surprise attack via Elis Helrot. Include multiple Tatooine: Mos Eisley to keep them from being reversed.\\par \\par Cards to watch out for: Dark Side Tatooine: Mos Eisley, Counter Assault.",
