When facing Imperial Justice (V), the immunity reduction is good because otherwise it could be problematic cracking Lord Vader's immunity < 6. Also, since you are battling you can count on making your opponent lose lots of Dark Jedi as well as lots of battles, so the additional Force loss is important. Furthermore, the card is destiny-6 and easily cycles back into your Reserve Deck for easy tracking. If you generate enough Force - and every mains deck should have solid generation - it will be an easy thing to pay the 3 Force \"upkeep\" cost if you should need to.\\par \\par SHEWSKI'S TAKE:\\par ADLR is #2 on my DS listing, and I have to take exception with DWTE being better than it. These cards aren't meant to stay on the table- this card is wonderful to cycle through your deck for destiny of whatnot. The upkeep is manageable, but I can't think of any time I've used this card and kept it on the table by paying for it.\\par -----\\par Article at DeckTech, September 19th, 2005\\par Top 5 Battle-Aiding V-Cards (Dark Side) by Armaedes and Shewski\\par \\par Deploy on table. All immunity to attrition is reduced by 3. You may not fire permanent weapons. Whenever a Jedi is lost, or opponent loses a battle, opponent loses 1 Force. During your draw phase, lose 1 Force or place this card in your Used Pile. (Immune to Alter.)\\par \\par Much like my #1 pick, I like the DS card a little more than the LS version. There are more Jedi that see play than Dark Jedi, and many have little immunity or none at all, which can mean guaranteed Force loss. This card is not meant to stay on the table, but cycle through your deck to show up as a big destiny draw or to deploy again for more Force loss. This works well w/ #1 as well, since you can't fire with your EPPs. The attrition reduction is a two-edged sword; so make sure you have some fodder. I can't tell you how many times it has turned a weak destiny draw into a site clearer. A great card that is fun to use along with other battle winning cards like Insignificant Rebellion.\\par \\par ARMAEDES' TAKE:\\par I agree completely with your assessment of the strengths of this card. The light side version made my list, but for dark side I just think there's far better battling helpers available. The strength of most of the powerful light side decks is EPP hit-and-run. I really only see the dark side version of this card being useful if you keep it on the table for a turn, so your opponent loses a Force from their EPP strike, or if you are going against an immunity-mains deck like Profit, which is unpopular at best, or the Careful Planning (V) Endor deck, which this card would work quite well against.",

Now instead of dropping your EPP and taking out a couple of characters, you can drop down your immunity main and take out a couple of characters and still have the immunity main around next turn to drain on the location. This also stops your opponent from messing with your destiny draw via the senate objective, which is important if you want to really cause some battle damage. Although this card appears more defensive in nature it can actually be a very powerful offensive card.\\par \\par SHEWSKI'S TAKE:\\par This ranks just outside my top 5 on both sides. CD/AAA have already conditioned you to getting more mileage out your immunity mains, this just reinforces that principle. I don't like this in the early game in case a key card gets trapped under the Effect, but mid-game onwards it is a welcome play. I think this will also give those decks that rely solely upon immunity mains (THGG, WHAP, Invasion) a little bump into playability. Remember, total battle destiny can still be affected!!\\par -----\\par This is the card old-school Star Wars CCG players have been waiting for since Reflections 3, a card that finally makes it to where your opponent can't use Boba Fett, Bounty Hunter, IG-88 With Riot Gun and 4-LOM With Concussion Rifle aboard Zuckuss In Mist Hunter to instantly end the game in a battle destiny-adding frenzy. Play this card - which you can start - and three battles per game you can limit both players to one battle destiny. Play two of this non-unique card and it's good for six battles per game, and few games have more than six battles (and not many have more than three).\\par \\par So besides limiting destiny-adding fetishes, what does this card really mean for light side? For one thing, it means light side immunity mains are back. Ben Kenobi being immune < 5 used to mean nothing when he was facing multiple draws. Now immune < 5 can only be cracked by a solid destiny draw. Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight armed with his saber is basically immune to attrition. Obi-Wan Kenobi (V) is even better.\\par \\par This card also works well in space. Playing I'll Take The Leader to give your Outrider immunity < 6 is huge now. The Millenium Falcon with the same Admiral's Order out is only going down to a draw of 7 or better. Home One is basically invincible.\\par \\par This card really brings SWCCG back to where it should be - when main characters are able to stay on the table for more than a turn or two, and your opponent really has to bring the beats to get rid of a big, bad main. Matching pilot starships are also a lot stronger now, and all of this is tempered by the fact that you can't play Bright Hope (V) and Tantive IV (V) and rule the sky by cancelling your opponent's only destiny draw. This is also a great card to use if you find yourself going against a destiny-cancelling team, as using this effect will prevent your destiny draw from being cancelled.\\par \\par This card is going to make a lot of light side decks viable again, as they won't have to worry about the Super-Fett beatdown as much. Dont' get goldenrody though - your opponent will still be able to brign a lot of power in your direction. Below is a deck that takes advantage of the newfound respect light mains are going to get due to this card. ",

The trick is that it has to be targeting a Jedi, but frankly most light battling decks are going to be heavy on the Jedi anyway (Mace Windu (V), Qui-Gon Jinn, Obi-Wan Kenobi and possible a Jedi persona of Luke Skywalker). Cancelling battle evasion is obviously a very good thing for a battling deck, but the card doesn't stop there. If your main should survive the battle and are still at the site, and the dark player retaliates, you can use this card to take the first action of the weapons phase, which means you can strike out at one of your opponent's characters before they have a chance to do any tricks with Dr. Evazan or Dark Strike.\\par \\par SHEWSKI'S TAKE:\\par #5?? Aw, man it's my #1. I don't want to steal my own thunder- so read on. I think this was a very good card to come out of the player designed card experiment.\\par When you deploy to battle in modern SWCCG, the biggest thing you fear is the re-beat, where your opponent minimizes your offensive power, reinforces on their turn, and then beats you down. Evasion and character removal are two prime ways to slow down a feisty LS player. IMI takes care of it all. I don't think its specificity is a hindrance at all. Barrier will often be saved for your big guns (Jedi). Most battles involve Jedi (Stunning), and YAB will target those aforementioned big guns. Being able to battle on your own terms is very nice. The secondary text is quite nice as well, as Armaedes pointed out. Though protective in nature, it can turn a defensive battle into an offensive one quickly.\\par \\par ARMAEDES' TAKE:\\par I agree that this is a great card, but #1? This is a very deck-specific card, as it won't work in a battling deck that isn't mains, and even in a mains deck it won't help you with EPP Luke.

With the number of ways dark side has to pull aliens from the deck, and with Jabba (V) doubling the power of almost all of them, you can create devastating beatdowns in record time.
