At first, the original strategy was to play a deck with 25 of your planet's Operative because they were broken on their planet. Basically it worked like this; your objective pulled the sites, then once you controlled three, you flipped. The flip side made all lightside drains -1, your operatives added +1 to force drains, deployed for one, forfeit for like 4 or 5, added a destiny at all sites while you had just one operative on the planet, and you retrieved a force every time you simply deployed one to a site. They were even power +2 against a Rebel. This was totally not a Star Wars movie idea, just crap that hurt the game.\\par \\par SPECIAL NOTE: Because of all the problems this objective caused. Decipher created three cards that completely hurt this deck as well as an errata to the rules saying that only one operative may be at a site, anymore would be lost. This objective is considered to be DEAD. Decipher created this idea with no thought of what they were doing. This objective is one that they wish they had never made. It won the '98 worlds for both sides because it was a broken idea.\\par \\par What Changed Since 1st Edition: Nothing, the objective still stinks. You play it, you are doing it as a surprise factor only. The only reason you should win with this objective is against someone who isn't playing with the counter cards or who doesn't know how it works. STAY AWAY!!!",

Since that would require a revision to thousands of cards, that's simply not practical. Every effort has been made to identify and discern what are and are not characteristics. Some may be missing from the list, while others are deliberately absent. Discerning which is which requires a bit of research and judgment.\\par \\par After investigating, we're adding skiff and sandcrawler to the list of characteristics which apply to vehicles.\\par \\par This brings us to the matter of (LS) Intruder Missile. This weapon and its possible interaction with Outrider has been a matter the PC has been considering for some time. By the rules, the one could not deploy on the other, but we were not ignorant of the possibility that this was an error of omission. Having looked through the evidence, we're now confident that Intruder Missile was not intended to work with Outrider.\\par \\par We do not make these decisions lightly, and attempt to be thorough in our research of the original intent of the card interactions. We searched the records of play testing that we have from the development of Shadows of the Empire (the set that was incorporated into Reflections 2). In an original version of the Outrider, it was created to work with Intruder Missile, both via game text and the inclusion of the \"YT-2400\" in the subtype box. However, the game text was stricken over the course of play testing, and the \"YT-2400\" text moved out of the subtype box into the lore. This move was significant - the characteristic rules were well in place at this time, and Decipher had ensured that references to starships were almost entirely to icons or the contents of the subtype box. The only exceptions to this were defined characteristics (all ships are enclosed and all TIE/sa and B-wings are bombers) or squadron designations (which could be found in title, lore, or game text). Decipher, in fact, released only one card which was referenced by its lore instead of subtype: Blockade Flagship, because \"Droid Control Ship\" would not fit in that box - and Decipher then made a note to declare Droid Control Ship a characteristic.\\par \\par Neither of these cases applied to Outrider - our tests using the original templates showed that \"YT-2400\" would fit with room to spare, and we know that Decipher made no such announcement. In addition, the text on Intruder Missile states that it also may deploy on the Falcon. It was not until two years after Intruder Missile came out that a Falcon was created that didn't state \"YT-1300\" in lore (both the original and Lando in Millennium Falcon did). If Decipher intended to reference it in lore, this specific mention wouldn't have been necessary.\\par \\par Given the state of the characteristic rules at the time by Decipher, the striking of the game text, and the deliberate choice to remove a referenced card aspect from the subtype box, we feel this is sufficient evidence to support the existing ruling: Intruder Missile may not deploy on Outrider.\\par \\par Because this matter has confused many players over the years, we are going to issue the following errata to Intruder Missile (LS) in the hopes of minimizing further confusion:\\par \\par LS Intruder Missile:\\par Deploy on your B-wing, Z-95, YT-1300 Transport, or Falcon.

At first, the idea was to play a deck with 25 of your planet's operatives because they were broke on their planet. Basic it worked like this. Your objective pulled the sites, then once you controlled three, you flipped. The flip side made all DS drains -1, your operatives added +1 to force drains, deployed for one, forfeit for like 4 or 5, added a destiny at all sites while you had just one operative on the planet, and you retrieved a force every time you simply deployed one to a site. They were even power +2 against an Imperial. This was totally not a Star Wars movie idea, just crap that hurt the game. The reason this objective was even made was because Lucas denied the creation for some of the card designs only weeks before the release of Special Edition. To fix this last minute problem, the Operative strategy was added without ANY play testing.\\par \\par SPECIAL NOTE: Because of all the problems this objective caused. Decipher created three cards that completely hurt this deck as well as an errata to the rules saying that only one operative may be at a site, anymore would be lost. They also no longer have presence, so they can't control a site by themselves. This objective is considered to be DEAD. Decipher created this idea with no thought of what they were doing. This objective is one that we all wish they had never made. It won the '98 worlds for both sides because it was a broken idea.",
