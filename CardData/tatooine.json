The second (and more likely to be seen) is the Interrupt from Tatooine, You'll Find I'm Full Of Surprises, which gives Luke some dueling ability. Lightsaber Parry will be useful against this card, as well as any future duel-initiating ability the Light Side might gain in the future.\\par \\par Lightsaber Parry also provides some interesting Used game text. If the Dark Side has a lightsaber in a just-initiated battle, this card will eliminate the ability of all lightsabers present to target characters. At first glance, this might seem a little silly. After all, while the Light Side won't be slicing and dicing, the Dark Side can't use their lightsabers, either. But there is a method to the madness. The Light Side still outnumbers the Dark in number of characters who can use the various unique lightsabers. In addition, the Light Side has a little more versatility, with Anakin's Lightsaber being usable by either Luke or Leia. These facts add up to a decent chance that the Light Side will have more lightsabers in a battle than the Dark Side. Now, sacrificing Darth Maul's chance to hit an opponent is more than offset by the fact that you have saved several of your characters from the blade.\\par \\par This text can also be useful when you have an important character with a low defense value in the battle. Characters with 1, 2, or even 3 ability are almost sure to be hit by a lightsaber. Now your Dark Jedi can keep that character alive and kicking for at least another turn.

Although both characters are not very strong, their strength lies in their game text.\\par \\par One good use of another 0 Dark Side Force icon location is to set up Tatooine so that you can control where the actions take place. By placing locations in a certain order, you can make Tatooine into a rat trap for the Dark Side. You can put one battleground in between the Slave Quarters and Obi-Wan's Hut. Doing so will force the opponent to deploy to the middle and if they try to escape, you can nab them at either non-battleground with less fear of a counterattack. Another way is to put both Slave Quarters and Obi-Wan's Hut together to create a partial haven for utility characters (e.g., Figrin D'an or Oola).",

Threepio shares Mirax Terrik's ability to circulate high destiny cards back into your deck and replace them with new cards from the Reserve Deck. What's even nicer about Threepio's ability is that, unlike Mirax, his ability can be used for free, and instead of placing the card on the bottom of the Used Pile, he places it on the top of the Used Pile for easier tracking when your Reserve Deck is larger.\\par \\par The other nice thing about Threepio's ability to place a high destiny card on top of your Used Pile is that if he's in a battle with Shmi, he can then take that high destiny card and place it on top of your Reserve Deck, ensuring a nice pull for weapon or battle destiny. And since Shmi can download Threepio right out of the Reserve Deck, the odds of you having them in a battle together are pretty good.\\par \\par The fact that this is a persona of C-3PO also has enormous benefits. Because most versions of C-3PO have only been strong in specialized decks, many of his support cards are quite powerful. For example, Were You Looking For Me? is a handy 5 Destiny Used Interrupt that allows you to pull Threepio and/or another protocol droid (like R-3PO) from your Reserve Deck. You can also use the same Interrupt as a Lost Interrupt to either retrieve Threepio from the Lost Pile or to add a battle destiny when Threepio is helping his friends out in battle (two battle destiny if he happens to have a few furry friends with him). Unlike most \"back\" cards, this card is very appealing because it's recyclable, free, high destiny, and has the battle destiny bonus.\\par \\par There are tons of other C-3PO suppport cards, including the ever-popular How Did We Get Into This Mess?, but one of my favorites is Artoo, I Have A Bad Feeling About This, which has three different uses, the best of which allows you to squash your opponent's battle destiny completely if both Artoo and C-3PO are together in battle.
